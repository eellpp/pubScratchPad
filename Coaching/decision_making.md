Life is a decision-making game.

Investments, what projects to work on, career changes…

The better decisions you make over the long term, the more successful you get.

But people make one common mistake while assessing their decisions.

They judge the quality of the decisions based on the outcomes. And this is a flaw that creates a dangerous illusion for future decisions.

Because life is not chess. It’s poker.

Luck plays a bigger role than you think.

Mike made a terrible decision by risking all his savings, but he got lucky.

Jane made a good decision by taking an opportunity with better conditions, but luck was not on her side.

Thinking in bets allows you to take luck (and probabilities) into consideration and makes you a better decision-maker in the game of life.

 1. Checkout blind spots in your thinking   
 2. Calculate the expected value of your decision: investment X success_probability   
 3. Analyze your past decisions  
 
 Blind Spots  
 - confirmation bias: We tend to remember and pay more attention to information that confirms our preexisting beliefs  
 - LOOK AT BIAS FROM DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES.
 - resistance to new things or the unfamiliar.
 
  when we’re tired or hungry, our brains rely more on that unconscious, fast processing, which studies have shown is more prone to bias.
