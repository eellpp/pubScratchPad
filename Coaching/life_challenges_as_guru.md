### Life Challenges as guru

Instead of avoiding or somehow getting through the challenge, meditate and think over it.  
Learn from it. Accept it as your guru  

A tough challenge is like your personal teacher.  
It will show mirror into yourself  
It will guide you in into the uncharted, which otherwise you wont   
It will tease you, Overwhelming you into submission.  

But when you are done  
You would be come out wiser.  
The intention is to teach you much more than challenge itself.
