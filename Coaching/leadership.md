If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, you are a leader.  

leadership is demonstrated when one at the ‘helm’ finds the confidence not to waver, even when the confidence of the team has wavered.   


### why some people are leaders and others followers
Leadership always starts with accepting more responsibility, becoming willing to do things with a progressive mindset, adopting a proactive and helping attitude, avoiding finger-pointing, accepting any mistakes and being ready to fix them, listening more than talking, and most importantly, having empathy for others. However, those who are the followers in our society generally do not practice these traits.  Most of the people who are referred to here as followers are controlled and dominated by external circumstances and ulterior motives of others. Many times, when followers try their best to act as leaders, their lack of genuine or sincere motives end up undermining their goals. In contrast, leaders walk and talk with a vision and stay focused to accomplish their goals. Leadership comes with a consistent practice of certain great values and beliefs and these characteristics and principles are seen throughout their real actions i.e. Having good listening habits, avoiding gossip at the workplace, being non-judgmental, respecting others, and helping colleagues. They don't try to participate in a race to show their achievements; rather, they focus on accomplishing the task for the benefit of the organization.   

Great leaders recognize that in order to be innovative, they will need to be able to take risks. These are calculated risks. The skill to weigh the risk and take upon risky bet is acquired over time by testing waters by smaller bets and then going on to bigger ones. It takes time for a leader to settle in and show the results. The initial years will show little or no success but there would be an exponential increase in years to come. 

Behavioural scientists conducted research into the link between risk-taking and leadership. The study revealed that people who take risks are more likely to be viewed as leaders and that risk-takers are particularly attractive when it comes to leadership in highly competitive situations. 

As a business leader and entrepreneur, your job is to put courage inside of people— to encourage them.With less fear and more courage, workers take on harder projects, deal better with change and speak up more willingly about important issues. In short, courageous workers try more, trust more and tell more.
