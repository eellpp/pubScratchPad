### Intrinsic vs Extrinsic motivation  
Intrinsic motivation involves performing a task because it's personally rewarding to you. Extrinsic motivation involves completing a task or exhibiting a behavior because of outside causes such as avoiding punishment or receiving a reward.  

When and Why Incentives (Don’t) Work to Modify Behavior

### Extrinsic motivation to create a habit
In the case of exercise, establishing a habit by requiring multiple and frequent visits seems necessary—especially for those who have little or no previous habit of
exercising. A self-commitment device, or even just a decision that would impel us to go to the gym for a month before evaluating the cost and benefit of exercising, it may
result in a different assessment of the net value of the activity.   

### Image motivation
People do social work to show to others that they are nice. Image motivation  
Person should be clean whether he is doing the activity to "do good" or "do well"  

To avoid image motivation, he should try to do it anonymously  

### Social reward vs cash  
Giving a social award like "recognizing with a trophy/certificate socially" is more motivating to people than giving them cash reward.  
Cash reward diminishes the social interaction  

Depending on their nature, incentives can shift a situation from a social to a monetary frame. Consider a thought experiment: You meet an attractive person,
and in due time you tell that person, “I like you very much and would like to have sex with you.” Alternatively, consider the same situation, but now you say, “I like you
very much and would like to have sex with you, and, to sweeten the deal,I’m also willing to pay you $20!” Only a certain kind of economist would expect your partner willing to pay you $20 to be happier in the second scenario. However, offering $20 worth of  (unconditional) flowers might indeed make the desired partner happier   


### External incentive are not good of promoting conceptual understanding
One possible interpretation of these results, compatible eading or social scienc suggests that external incentives may be more effective in concrete subjects, such as primary school math, than in more conceptual topics such as reading and social sciences (Rouse, 1998). uch as reading and social sciences (Rouse, 1998)  


## Developing Intrinsic motivation 

### The environment

Increased intrinsic motivation can be encouraged by building environments that promote:

`Autonomy` – people need to believe they have choices.  
- Have a say in what they are doing.
- Frame goals as being essential to individual success.
- Let people choose to perform rather than being pressured to deliver.

`Relatedness` – people need to deepen their connections with others.  
- Identify how people feel regarding what they do.
- Encourage people to develop their values while working.
- Connect their work to a higher cause (political, moral, spiritual, or corporate).

`Competence` – people need to have the right skills and the opportunity to show them.
- Make resources available for learning.
- Set learning goals rather than result-oriented goals
- Ask “how did you grow today and what do you need for tomorrow?” rather than “what did you achieve today?”
- Such practices and environments are applicable in most contexts and should not be limited to the workplace.

### Perception is everything. Storytelling 
How we feel about our work is typically less about the activity and more about how we frame it. For example, are you a bricklayer merely putting one brick on top of another, or are you part of a team building a church?  

Is the task mundane and pointless, or are you creating a better environment for others?  

The medical student studying their anatomy books late on a Friday night is either preparing for an in-class test on Monday or readying themselves to save lives in a future hospital placement (Grenny, 2019). Perception is everything.  

### Students/Practioners should feel they have autonomy and feel relevance
- autonomy regarding when and how they do their work  
- Do the students understand the relevance or purpose of this piece of work? For example, perhaps it leads to something further down the line or a larger piece of work within the class.  


## Self motivation

### Find your one sentence
Most of us live a life of many goals with our time spread thinly across each one.  
In his book, Drive, Daniel Pink (2018) challenges readers to regain focus and clarify their purpose.  
He asks us to define a sentence that sums up our life.  

To help, he offers two examples from U.S. Presidents:  

- Abraham Lincoln’s sentence might be He preserved the Union and freed the slaves.
- Franklin Roosevelt’s might be He lifted us out of the Great Depression and helped us win the war.
What’s yours?  
Each day, ask yourself, Am I closer to my goals than I was the day before? What do I need to do tomorrow to move forward in the right direction?
