Quote from steve jobs:  
Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it.  

Its your life.  
Their is no one way of what is right or wrong way of living life.  
What is commonly told as right pattern/way is the path that maintains social order while works generally for the followers.  
While living is society you need to follow the essential social norms. (security, health,education and care)  
But you may not want society or the leaders to trespass into your arena the other aspects of life. 
Success measures in those areas are defined by you and yourself alone.  

- A capitistic person living in marxist time/society should hold on to his beliefs  
- A marxist person living in captilistic time/society should hold on to his beliefs  
- A XXXX person living in opposite-XXXX times/society should hold on it his beliefs  

### Guilt/Regret  
Time lost in figuring out the right path for yourself Vs just following what others are doing and still getting to same destination  

One persons success-criteria can be another persons absolute failure  

What are your beliefs ? (Unless experienced life on your own for 1 or 2 decades, trying what's out there, its difficult to answer this )   
- the first step is just follow what others are doing
- soon you find other better things that makes you contended  
- once achieving them, at the cost of others, you find it was not so worthwhile in loosing everything else
- you are confused and start questioning your beliefs and see things they are. You have just woken up 
- Now you are experimenting and really figuring out. There is no failures, since ever step gets one obstacle out of the destination  

Living other people's dream  


### Work vs hobby
Each of us have x amount of capacity for different things and success in life hinges on figuring out how to hit x consistently across all categories.

Someone whose capacity for reading is 5000 pages per week who has a job that requires 4000 pages of reading will come up with hobbies that provide another 1000 pages of reading. If crunch time requires 5000 pages per week temporarily, the hobby will disappear. If he gets a job requiring 5500 pages of reading, the hobby will disappear and he will start to burn out.  

Somethings in daily life:
- hands on work in kitchen/garden  
- artistic expression : painting, music, prose ,drama
- engineering and problem solving : design, programming , strategy, analysis 

Advice for hobby: Fix a time and stick to it. When you start to put more time than the scheduled, then its no longer a hobby and entering into work area  
- eg: sat fixing the garden from 3 - 6 pm
- painting from 10 to 11 pm
