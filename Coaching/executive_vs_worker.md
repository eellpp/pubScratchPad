Leadership differences between executive and worker   
Each role has success metrics  

Worker:  
- Follows instructions
- May not be discussed before decisions regarding work 
- Does not question the authority most of the times
- Focus on the craftsmanship than leadership 

Executive:
- Need to think on the larger picture how the company/product could do better
- Need to think two steaps ahead ahead on the future direction of the product/company
- Need to voice his opinion and steer decisions on what he thinks is the right direction. 
- Need to take negative feedback positively and should be able to voice straight opinions. 
- Need to build rappo with the leadership team to be in the tribe. Able to read the room and steer the thinking.
- Need to ensure his team members are well supported by him in their growth
- understanding the relationship status with other senior management and cultivate them

A executive is shown door by 
- not being invited to decision making meetings and deliberations. If he is not involved in decisions then he is not an executive.  
- is asked to execute the decisions

A worker is show door by
- asked to perform task outside of his skill area

If executives in the company do not speak up, keep thoughts in to themself because of lack of confidence or fear of negative reprisal then the company is doomed.  

Executive thinking:

> Start pushing. Live into that dream. Be the one that gets people excited. Be the one that can give the feedback that needs to be given, no matter who they are in the company. Be the one that aligns the company. Be the one that thinks more strategically than anyone else in the company, regardless of titles — they aren't important. Be the one that the company knows in its bones is responsible for the direction of the company. Be the navigation system for the company.

> The CEO sets the destination. You get the company there.

> You plan a route and know the next two directions by memory. You are reassessing the plan every minute to see if you need to re-route.

> Be assertive and opinionated even when you aren't as sure. Go back to having strong beliefs. Know your beliefs. Hold onto them. Especially when it *feels* right. Especially when you can point to historical events. No one should be able to shake you of your beliefs. No one in the company is above you for ensuring the success of the product. Don’t be an asshole about it, but push for what you need and don’t give in to every request.


### CEO responsibility
CEO executes by leading people. He is the chief motivator. Both extrensic (giving money,power etc) and more than that providing interinsic motivation
