To claim our power requires learning to live consciously, taking responsibility for ourselves and our choices, building self-esteem, and asking directly for our needs and wants. As we learn to express ourselves honestly and set boundaries and say no, we create safety and mutual respect, allowing our partners to do the same.

Becoming more autonomous also is important, not only to build self-esteem. Autonomy assures us that we can survive on our own. That knowledge makes us less dependent on others’ approval. True freedom flows from being autonomous.  

- do not voluntarily give up our power to others
- do not think that exercising power will alienate others  
- do not think that we are mean in telling others what we want or we don't want
- be assertive and do not defer easily to others decision just like that
- do not be discomfortable with power and believe that hurts relationships  
- take responsiblity and do not blame others 
- do not deny your needs, wants and feelings
- do not self denigrate your effort, work , time. If you value them, others will value too. 
- learn to say no giving clear and concise reason. Do not be apologetic or overly give reasons. 

In somewhat healthier relationships, both partners vie for power in ongoing power struggles. If that is not the case, then one party becomes acquiescent partner and attempts to exert influence in indirect or passive-aggressive ways, such as withholding. 

### Saying no/rebelling sometimes is necessary to boost self
Rebelling and saying no sometimes is like getting a flue to make immune system stronger to fight other flue types. It works better than staying isolated or avoiding the flue.   
Just like flue, rebel taking precautions that you can handle the consequences and its not going to be fatal.  

When you take the opposing stand, you are forced to stand on your own. It does not matter finally you are right or wrong.  
Self protection  will kick in, it will energise you and you would be left much stronger.  

### Give up the bad habit of pleasing others for acceptance
Such a behaviour is indicator of having grown up in families where power was exercised over them in a dominant-submissive pattern. Their needs and feelings were ignored or criticized. When personal power and self-worth isn’t encouraged, we come to believe that power and love can’t coexist. Power gets a bad rep. We’re afraid of our own power and to feel safe and loved learn to accommodate and please others

Power is in asking. 

### Aggression and Assertion are good  

A lot of programmers often seem to be more nice guys than anything else, and need to be able to be more assertive / aggressive.  

aggression is just assertion when it's judged to be inappropriate or incompetently done - a drill instructor being assertive looks different to a police officer in a stand-off which is different to how you talk to co-workers - the distinction is highly contextual and subjective.  

I think a lot of people with poor social skills thinks the aggression / assertion line is all about being angry or shouty or rude. Assertion uses a bunch of tools (including potentially - a louder or quieter voice, appearing angry, threats, manipulations, etc) to achieve a goal. Doing so in an inappropriate way is seen as aggressive (e.g. threatening to quit over a minor issue). Overusing any given tool (e.g. swearing a lot instead of realising a different tool is needed) is seen as incompetent (or losing control) thus it's seen as aggressive. But fundamentally there's no real objective difference.
