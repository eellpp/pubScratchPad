Your study is of genuine curiosity  
You are not trying to impress upon anyone. You are not motivated by how others may think about it.  
The purpose of study is not biased towards optimizing other side benefits of the study. Like the potentials paths it can open, unintended monetary, social or other benefits  
It is genuine exploration, where every seld belief is objectively questioned if it does not aligns with the facts that are unerthed during study. 
You are not disallusioned by the time it took and it may take. Rather you are joyed by the exploratory experience during the study  

Doing original thinking is tough. But it is also one of joys of living human life fully. Never let that opportunity go.
