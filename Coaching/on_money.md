What money DOES do is reveal a person's character. That means that the influence that money has on each one of us reveals the values by which we live our lives. If an honest person is presented with an opportunity to acquire large sums of money in a dishonest manner, they will not be tempted in the least.

A person lives a frugal life in trailer park while in remote community, donating the millions he has to the community after death.  

The person does not have much social relationships. No wife, children or relationships with relatives.  
He is in remote town as part of community. 
He has millions, but sees little use of falaunting it.  
Instead does odd jobs at old age.  

Outside of social construct, money has little use after the needs are met. 
- Work, 
- your relationship with work (is it love, love-hate or hate)
- your social group and strength of relationships, bonding and care

In the broader essence of living, money itself is a convinient social construct. Living, experiencing various dimensions of life is what matters most.
