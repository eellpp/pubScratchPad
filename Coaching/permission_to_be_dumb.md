You are going to be dumb, lame, awkward, etc at pretty much anything you haven't done before  

performance anxiety that gets in the way of doing new things  

It wasn't about learning more skills or working hard, being strong or anything else.  
It is about giving myself permission to be dumb, boring, lame, and still accepting myself at the end of the day.   
And once I'm able to do that, there's no more anxiety, and then everything becomes much easier. I feel like this is a path to a more natural sort of confidence
