Two steps into achieving any life goals. Whether its becoming writer, business, reducing weight etc. Anything that looks daunting to achieve with current life. 

Eg: To become a writer 

**step 1)** Reserve a block of time each day to write

**step 2)** Do nothing but just write during that scheduled block of time
- if you are feeling good , relaxed then write with that
- if you are feeling angry annoyed etc then write with that
- if you are feeling confused, distracted, depressed then write with that
whatever be your emotional state, if you are on your own during the block of time , just write

This is how stuff gets done. The hard work is to labour through those days when you don't want to do things

### Break Procrastination in step 2
Do the smallest step in the direction. Do not idle time doing nothing  
Example: If you are on bed and have to go work on desk. Move the toe, then the leg and go on. Do in the smallest step towards the step 2.
