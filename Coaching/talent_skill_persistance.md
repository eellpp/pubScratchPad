### Talent vs Skill  
The separation of talent and skill is one of the greatest misunderstood concepts for people who are trying to excel, who have dreams, who want to do things. Talent you have naturally. Skill is only developed by hours and hours and hours of beating on your craft.  : Will Smith  

The person who is willing to push hard into their field is probably %80 of what people call talent. And then when they encounter the obsessed after the fact, they call it talent because they're effectively the same outliers.

### Keep Moving
If you can’t fly, then run, if you can’t run then walk if you can’t walk then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward  - MLK  


### Persistance
Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence.   
Talent will not;  
nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. 
Genius will not;   
unrewarded genius is almost a proverb.  
Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts.   
Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent.   
The slogan Press On! has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race.  -  
Calvin Coolidge   

### Studying facts vs understanding to reveal the mysteries unknown to you 
In school you are often taught true statements ("facts"), but that is not the same as knowledge. You can make factualy correct statements, without understanding things.  

Knowledge is about understanding how and why things work. Facts have low rentention. 
- Applying things to uncover what is out there
- Question and testing all othe possiblem explanations and methods
- Experiments to verify it
- Applying the method/knowhow to other problems in realm to explore

This is tedious. Hard work. Weeks could be lost in exploring things. However only when you have climbed those peaks, you can see further on what lies out there.
