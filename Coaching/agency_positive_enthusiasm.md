### Agency and Positive Enthusiasm
Smartness is a part of human brain. Agency is the part that asks questions to smartness and further decides based on it.  

1) A person who is smart but has no agency: He is disinterested in life. Not achieving anything. He is just not asking questions and try to reach out and achieve   
2) A person who has agency but not smart: He is trying to achieve things but all actions leads of failures from which unable to come back   
3) A person who is smart and has agency: He making goals, strategises, holds nerves, with will power able to persist, learn from failures and achieve goals. Constantly trying to achieve  

**Leadership**  
Leaders are third type of people, who also understand their own weakness. Things that their smart brain is not so good at. They are always on lookout for these weakness and situations that triggers them. They hire people who are smart and have strengths in areas that they are weak.A leader is always on lookout for patterns where his smart brain is not good enough. He deligates those to other smart people whom he hired. This way is scales up his decision making by leveraging on multiple smart people brains. However the agency is only his. The agency is what makes the leader a leader. 

**Positive enthisiasm (PE) is the only way of living a good life**    
Two persons with equal capabilities and put in difficult situation.  
First person cribs about life, luck and others in his life. He is constantly questioning why to do anything. He is disinterested and want to go back into cave. Away from everyone and everything. His sad, angry and dejected.     
Second person is trying to find a way out. He dreams of better future prospects. He keeps trying even though hits failures. He is still positive and enthusiastic. He will keep trying to find a way out till the last breath believing in good life ahead. He is energetic, hopeful and finds happiness in chasing the dreams.     

The way to live better life is being positively enthusiastic. It not about finally achieving those goals, or even about whether those goals are achievable or the future glory upon achieving those. The satistaction is in the positive feeling, the feeling of hope and good feeling that one feels all through the life while working enthusiastically towards achieving the goals that he dreams of.     

PE is the only way of living a good life.
