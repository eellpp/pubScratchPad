People’s perspectives are based on their own experiences.  

However hard you try you can't think like them. 

Your own thoughts are based on all the experiences you had and are biased with that. It takes enormous effort to overcome that bias. 

Since others words/actions are biased by their experiences. Listen to them. Understand them. But you don't need to always react to them. You have the choice.  

Don't take things personally. Since everything is colored by personal biases and does not reflect the truth. 

The reality is that nothing people say or do to you is actually about you – it’s all about them.

When you get upset by something someone said to you, it’s about your own fears and experiences, which makes it essential to deal with this.

You can’t blame your parents for how they raised you. That’s what they were taught by their parents and the environment around them
