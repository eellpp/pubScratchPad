### Key points – How to take things less personally
`personalisation` is believing that you’re the cause of a negative event, despite having little or no evidence to support the belief.   
`mind reading` is believing that someone is making a critical judgment about you, especially in an ambiguous situation where you’ve received no direct feedback.  


Examples:  
The other day, I found out that one of my close friends had an extra ticket to a football playoff game, and he invited another friend instead of me. Hurt by this apparent slight, I thought I must have done something to make my friend mad, but I couldn’t figure out what it was. I also wondered if my friend thought I’d be a boring guest who’s not much fun to bring to a game. I wasn’t quite sure at first how to handle it, but eventually I decided to casually share what I’d heard the next time I saw him. He replied: ‘Yeah, I thought about asking you, but I know you don’t like football,’ which made me laugh – in part because it was true, but also because I had been so focused on what I believed this incident said about me that I overlooked a more likely explanation for his decision.  

If you ask your server at a restaurant to explain exotic dishes or ingredients, you might imagine that they view you as pushy or uncultured  
if you struggle to describe the details of your pet’s symptoms when you call the veterinarian, you might worry that they think you’re wasting their time.  

There are several problems with these errors in thinking. 
1. The first, of course, is that they’re inaccurate, driven more by feelings, personal histories, ambiguity and conspicuously negative information than by objectivity.  
2. Another is that, if you commit to these biased beliefs, you limit your emotional options to feeling sad about your perceived flaws, anxious about your ability to withstand upcoming social challenges, or angry at others for not being nicer.  
3. Finally, they limit your behavioural options. If you accept these thoughts as facts, it can be hard to see past giving up, avoiding or lashing out. In short, these tendencies to take things too personally restrict your emotional and behavioural options and increase the likelihood that you’ll struggle with distress or dysfunction.  
4. These things distort your sense of what’s actually happening.

Often, thoughts suggesting that a problem is your fault or that someone must be judging you negatively are compounded by other kinds of distorted thinking. You might not only treat an ambiguous behaviour as a personal slight but also tell yourself that it reflects a problem with you, one that will last forever and affect everything you do. 

### What to do 

1. `Distinguish your feelings from your thoughts`: While your feelings are not debatable, your self-critical thoughts can be challenged, revised or replaced.
2. `Look for signs that you are personalising or mind reading`. When you experience a difficult emotion, consider whether it followed the thought that you’re at fault or that someone thinks unfavourably of you.
3. `List the evidence for and against your thoughts`: Try writing down your difficult feeling, the situation that caused it, and how you explain what happened. What supports your explanation? What challenges it?
4. `See if there’s an explanation that isn’t just about you`: Consider whether it makes more sense to adopt an alternative account of what happened.
5. `Ask yourself, what’s useful?`: Proactively anticipating the risk of biased thoughts and committing to useful social behaviours helps reduce the tendency to take others’ words and actions too personally.
6. `Accept a reasonable amount of uncertainty`: You can’t always know what people are thinking about you, but you can decide how you’d like to conduct yourself.
