### Limbic systems and dopamine
When delight comes our way, or even the anticipation of delight, other emotional part of the brain, the limbic system, shoot off large quantities of the neurotransmitter dopamine. 
Dopamine is a type of neurotransmitter. Your body makes it, and your nervous system uses it to send messages between nerve cells. That's why it's sometimes called a chemical messenger.  

Drugs such as cocaine can cause a big, fast increase of dopamine in your brain. That satisfies your natural reward system in a big way. But repeated drug use also raises the threshold for this kind of pleasure. This means you need to take more to get the same high. Meanwhile, drugs make your body less able to produce dopamine naturally. This leads to emotional lows when you’re sober.  

In obese people, the body may not release enough dopamine and another feel-good hormone, serotonin. The reward system of body is not working and so they don't know when to stop eating or how much is enough.  

Too less and too much of dopamine is body causes issues. Natural degeneration of nuerons causes less production of dopamine which then has its effects on body.  

### Early morning activity
When dopamine is released in the brain, it creates feelings of alertness and wakefulness.

Animal studies show that dopamine is released in large amounts in the morning when it’s time to wake up and that levels naturally fall in the evening when it’s time to go to sleep.  

For high performance, its better to hook on to body rythms. One of the tricks is to sleep early and wake up early around 4:30 and use the hormone flow to get work done.
