### The self-esteem debt

"They're borrowing against their future accomplishments to feel good about themselves today, hoping they'll be able to pay it back."

e.g., Joe Schmo has grand plans to be an amazing detective and those plans affect who he is today. He has more self-esteem now because of how he sees himself in the future. That's OK if he actually tries his damnedest to achieve his goal. Whether or not he achieves them is immaterial, as TLP points out. The key is

But if instead he just thinks about it and tells people (maybe even to impress them) but never actually pursues it, and 10 years later he's still just a middle manager at office max, well now he's fucked. He's either got to go into further self-esteem debt or he's got to file bankruptcy and work ten times as hard to repair his credit and get back on his feet. If he does the former he'll face the same decision in another five years.

And of course, why would he work hard and pursue it? High school was easy, he got As. College was easy, he got As. So what changed? Why isn't being a great detective easy? Why can't he just show up?
