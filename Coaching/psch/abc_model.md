### ABC Model  
In this model, the “A” is an activating  event, “B” is the belief, and “C” is the consequent emotion.  

The worries that plague us unnecessarily are the result of irrational beliefs triggered by the event. 

For example, you may worry that you’ll make a terrible mistake the next time you get into a new relationship. This worry comes from the belief that you’re not really a very likeable person and that everyone “must” like you (what Ellis called “masturbation”). The activating event can be anything ranging from an email exchange to a goodnight kiss. It’s the belief, the irrational one, which causes you to experience unnecessary worry and anxiety.

Ellis believes that it is not the activating event (A) that causes negative emotional and behavioral consequences (C), but rather that a person interpret these events unrealistically and therefore has a irrational belief system (B) that helps cause the consequences (C).  

### Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) 
Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) is a type cognitive therapy first used by Albert Ellis which focuses on resolving emotional and behavioral problems. The goal of the therapy is to change irrational beliefs to more rational ones. 
REBT Example  
Gina is upset because she got a low mark on a math test. The Activating event, A, is that she failed her test. The Belief, B, is that she must have good grades or she is worthless. The Consequence, C, is that Gina feels depressed.  

After irrational beliefs have been identified, the therapist will often work with the client in challenging the negative thoughts on the basis of evidence from the client's experience by reframing it, meaning to re-interpret it in a more realistic light. This helps the client to develop more rational beliefs and healthy coping strategies.  

A therapist would help Gina realize that there is no evidence that she must have good grades to be worthwhile, or that getting bad grades is awful.  She desires good grades, and it would be good to have them, but it hardly makes her worthless.  

If she realizes that getting bad grades is disappointing, but not awful, and that it means she is currently bad at math or at studying, but not as a person, she will feel sad or frustrated, but not depressed. The sadness and frustration are likely healthy negative emotions and may lead her to study harder from then on
