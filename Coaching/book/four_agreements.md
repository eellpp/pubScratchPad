The key message of this book is that from the moment we’re born, we are made to conform to society’s rules. This stops us from finding our true selves  

### The First Agreement : Your words programme the your brain, they can librate or enslave. Impeccable in choosing words. 
Being impeccable with your internal language means not judging or blaming yourself. Simply having those thoughts means you’re sinning against yourself. You need to change this, and start telling yourself how great you actually are, and giving yourself some TLC.  
A key point is that we should remember is that the words we choose to use are powerful – they can liberate or enslave you and others. How many times have you told yourself you’re stupid, or no good at something? Every time you do this, you are making an agreement and choosing to stick by it.  
- Use powerful words. Take note of them when you come across  
- Avoid words like : fool, stupid, moron etc for self.  

**Solution: Your words transform the way you think, and affect the opinions of others, so choose them wisely.**

### The Second Agreement: Don't take it personally
When people are rude to us, it can often stay in our mind for too long, and we constantly repeat the words in our heads. When you take things personally, you begin inadvertently agreeing with the slight and making it yours, even if it had nothing too do with you.

**Solution: The reality is that nothing people say or do to you is actually about you – it’s all about them. When you get upset by something someone said to you, it’s about your own fears and experiences, which makes it essential to deal with this.**

- Don't give others the power to hurt you again and again in your thoughts.  

Overcoming this issue means you have to know who you are, because then you don’t need to have other people’s acceptance, and nothing they say will hurt you. Everyone looks at the world from a different viewpoint, and you should also recognize your own perspective in this.

### The Third Agreement : Don't make Assumptions
The Third Agreement tells us that instead of making assumptions, we should ask questions instead.
We often jump to conclusions and make assumptions that are wildly wrong. If you say “hi” to a friend, and they don’t reply, you would perhaps make the assumption that they were mad at you without any real evidence.

When you have trouble understanding something, you assume you know what it means. When things become clear, you can see that it means something else entirely.

We also make assumptions about ourselves, such as whether or not we can do a particular task well. We might think we can, fail, and then feel bad for overestimating our abilities. In reality, we may just have needed to ask more questions to make it a success.

**Solution: You need to replace assumptions with questions instead. This can be difficult, but it’s the only way to get the answers you need.**

### The Fourth Agreement: Do your best
Always do your best, even if your best constantly changes.  
On certain days your best will be world-beating, and on others maybe it’s just a struggle to get something positive done, but you do something.  

**Solution: To do your best, you should do things because you want to, not because of external motivation like a paycheck. Doing a job that you dislike just for a salary is difficult and joyless, and is sometimes the reason you will end up drinking and partying at the weekend, just to forget your frustration.**  

If you love the job or task you’re doing, you’ll do your best without even trying. Your work will feel effortless and you’ll perform much better. This final agreement will help you to increase the power of the other agreements, while freeing yourself from old patterns.

What you are seeing and hearing right now is nothing but a dream. You’re dreaming right now in this moment. You’re dreaming with the brain awake. Before we were born the humans before us created a big outside dream that we will call society’s dream, or the dream of the planet. The dream of the planet includes all of society’s rules, its beliefs, its laws, its religions, different cultures and ways to be, its governments, schools, social events, and holidays. The outside dream has so many rules that when a new human is born, we hook the child’s attention and introduce these rules into his or her mind. As children, we didn’t have the opportunity to choose our beliefs, but we agreed with the information that was passed to us from the dream of the planet via other humans. I call this process the domestication of humans. We trust what we believe, and our beliefs set us up for suffering. In the dream of the planet, it is normal for humans to suffer, to live in fear, and to create emotional dramas. Our personal dream can also become an ongoing nightmare where we suffer and live in a state of fear. But we don’t need to dream a nightmare. It is possible to enjoy a pleasant dream. There are thousands of agreements you have made with yourself, with other people, with God, with society, with your parents, with your spouse, with your children. But the most important agreements are the ones you made with yourself. In these agreements you tell yourself who you are, what you feel, what you believe, and how to behave. One single agreement is not such a problem, but we have many agreements that make us suffer, that make us fail in life. If you want to live a life of joy and fulfillment, you have to find the courage to break those agreements that are fear-based and claim your personal power. When we’re finally ready to change our agreements, there are four very powerful agreements that will help us break those agreements that come from fear and deplete our energy. You need a very strong will in order to adopt The Four Agreements. But if you can begin to live your life with these agreements, the transformation in your life will be amazing.


“What you are seeing and hearing right now is nothing but a dream. You are dreaming right now in this moment. You are dreaming with the brain awake. Dreaming is the main function of the mind, and the mind dreams twenty-four hours a day. It dreams when the brain is awake, and it also dreams when the brain is asleep. The difference is that when the brain is awake, there is a material frame that makes us perceive things in a linear way. When we go to sleep we do not have the frame, and the dream has the tendency to change constantly. Humans are dreaming all the time. Before we were born the humans before us created a big outside dream that we will call society's dream or the dream of the planet. The dream of the planet is the collective dream of billions of smaller, personal dreams, which together create a dream of a family, a dream of a community, a dream of a city, a dream of a country, and finally a dream of the whole humanity. The dream of the planet includes all of society's rules, its beliefs, its laws, its religions, its different cultures and ways to be, its governments, schools, social events, and holidays. We are born with the capacity to learn how to dream, and the humans who live before us teach us how to dream the way society dreams. The outside dream has so many rules that when a new human is born, we hook the child's attention and introduce these rules into his or her mind. The outside dream uses Mom and Dad, the schools, and religion to teach us how to dream. Attention is the ability we have to discriminate and to focus only on that which we want to perceive. We can perceive millions of things simultaneously, but using our attention, we can hold whatever we want to perceive in the foreground of our mind. The adults around us hooked our attention and put information into our minds through repetition. That is the way we learned everything we know. By using our attention we learned a whole reality, a whole dream. We learned how to behave in society: what to believe and what not to believe; what is acceptable and what is not acceptable; what is good and what is bad; what is beautiful and what is ugly; what is right and what is wrong.“
