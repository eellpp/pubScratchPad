### Start the day by accomplishing something 
If you make your bed every morning you will have accomplished the first task of the day.   
It will give you a small sense of pride, and it will encourage you to do another task and another and another. 
By the end of the day, that one task completed will have turned into many tasks completed.  
Making your bed will also reinforce the fact that little things in life matter.  
If you can't do the little things right, you will never do the big things right.  

And, if by chance you have a miserable day, you will come home to a bed that is made that you made â€” and a made bed gives you encouragement that tomorrow will be better.

If you want to change the world, start off by making your bed.

- Admiral William H. McRaven
