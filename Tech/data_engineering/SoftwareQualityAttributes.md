### Key Guidelines:

- **Separation of Concerns (SoC)**: Dividing the system into distinct features with minimal overlap in functionality to enhance modularity and maintainability.
- **Dependency Injection (DI)**: Injecting dependencies rather than hardcoding them to promote flexibility, testability, and loose coupling.
- **Inversion of Control (IoC)**: Reversing the flow of control to a framework or container, enhancing modularity and flexibility.
- **Immutability**: Designing objects that cannot be modified after creation, increasing stability and thread safety.
- **Design Patterns**: Applying common solutions like Singleton, Factory, Strategy, and Observer to address recurring design problems.
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Ensuring that classes are open for extension but closed for modification to promote extensibility.
- **DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Reducing duplication in code to enhance maintainability and reusability.
