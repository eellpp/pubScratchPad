### Eventual Consistency

	•	Concept: In distributed systems, eventual consistency means that, given enough time, all nodes in the system will converge to the same state, even if they don’t have immediate consistency.
	•	Importance: Eventual consistency is a key concept in distributed systems and NoSQL databases, allowing for better availability and partition tolerance in systems that can handle temporary inconsistencies.
	•	Example: A distributed database like Amazon DynamoDB where writes are eventually propagated to all replicas, and reads might temporarily return stale data until consistency is achieved.
