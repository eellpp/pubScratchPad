## 4. **Functional Programming Paradigms**
   - **Concept**: Functional programming emphasizes functions that are pure, avoiding mutable state and side effects. Concepts like higher-order functions, closures, and first-class functions are central to this paradigm.
   - **Importance**: Functional programming techniques lead to more predictable, maintainable, and testable code, especially in concurrent environments.
   - **Example**: Using functions like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` in Java Streams to process collections in a declarative and side-effect-free manner.
