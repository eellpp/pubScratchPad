## CAP Theorem

	•	Concept: The CAP Theorem states that in a distributed data store, you can only achieve two out of the following three guarantees: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.
	•	Importance: Understanding CAP Theorem helps engineers make informed trade-offs when designing distributed systems, particularly in terms of how to handle network failures.
	•	Example: A system like Apache Cassandra is designed to be partition-tolerant and available, accepting eventual consistency as a trade-off.
