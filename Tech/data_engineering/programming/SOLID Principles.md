## 5. **SOLID Principles**
   - **Concept**: SOLID is an acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion.
   - **Importance**: These principles help in creating robust, scalable, and maintainable object-oriented systems.
   - **Example**: The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) suggests that a class should have only one reason to change, promoting separation of concerns and easier code maintenance.
