## **Concurrency and Parallelism**
   - **Concept**: Concurrency is the ability to run multiple tasks or processes simultaneously, while parallelism is about performing multiple operations simultaneously. These concepts are essential for improving performance and responsiveness in modern applications.
   - **Importance**: Understanding concurrency and parallelism allows engineers to design systems that can efficiently handle multiple tasks, making better use of resources like multi-core processors.
   - **Example**: Using a thread pool to manage background tasks in a web server, or employing the Fork/Join framework in Java to parallelize processing of large datasets.
