### Separation of Concerns

	•	Concept: Separation of concerns involves organizing code in such a way that different aspects or concerns of a program are separated, making it easier to manage and modify.
	•	Importance: It leads to cleaner, more modular code, where changes in one part of the system have minimal impact on others.
	•	Example: Using MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture to separate the data model, user interface, and control logic in web applications.
