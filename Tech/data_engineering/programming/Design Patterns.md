## Design Patterns

	•	Concept: Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems. They capture best practices and provide templates for solving particular design challenges.
	•	Importance: Knowledge of design patterns helps engineers recognize and apply solutions to recurring problems, leading to more efficient and maintainable code.
	•	Example: The Singleton pattern ensures a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of access to it. The Observer pattern allows objects to be notified of changes in other objects.
