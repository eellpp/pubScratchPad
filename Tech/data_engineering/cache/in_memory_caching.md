table of some popular **in-memory caching packages for Java**, along with their main features and the types of problems they are best suited for:

| **Cache Package**  | **Main Features** | **Best Suited for** |
|--------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Ehcache**        | - Supports both **in-memory** and **disk-based** caching. <br> - **JCache (JSR-107)** compliant. <br> - Easily integrates with **Hibernate**. <br> - Can handle **distributed caching** with clustering in the enterprise version. | - **Web applications** (for session caching). <br> - **Hibernate 2nd-level caching**. <br> - Large-scale enterprise applications requiring scalable and persistent caching. |
| **Caffeine**       | - Provides **near-optimal hit rate** with a **Least Recently Used (LRU)** eviction policy. <br> - Fast, lightweight, and highly concurrent. <br> - Supports **asynchronous loading**, expiration, and refreshes. | - **High-performance applications** requiring low-latency access to cached data. <br> - Suitable for applications where cache efficiency and performance are critical (e.g., **real-time systems**, **gaming**, etc.). |
| **Hazelcast**      | - Distributed, **in-memory data grid**. <br> - Supports **Near Cache** and **Off-Heap Storage**. <br> - Integrated with **Hazelcast Jet** for stream processing. <br> - Allows for **multi-data center replication**. | - Suitable for **distributed applications**, **cloud-native applications**, and **microservices**. <br> - Ideal for environments requiring **distributed caching** and **real-time event processing**. |
| **Apache Ignite**   | - **In-memory data grid** with SQL support. <br> - Supports **distributed joins** and complex queries. <br> - Provides **near cache** for client-side caching. <br> - Integrated **native persistence** for durable storage. | - Best for applications requiring **real-time analytics**, **distributed computing**, and **data caching**. <br> - Ideal for **computational grids** and applications that need to run **SQL queries** over cached data. |
| **Infinispan**      | - Distributed, **highly scalable cache**. <br> - **Transactional support** for cache. <br> - JCache (JSR-107) compliant. <br> - Supports **off-heap memory**, clustering, and cloud deployment. | - Suitable for **distributed, transactional systems**. <br> - Ideal for use in **microservices** and **cloud environments** requiring high availability and scalability. |
| **Guava Cache**    | - Simple, lightweight **in-memory caching**. <br> - Supports **time-based eviction** and **size-based eviction**. <br> - Thread-safe operations but no distributed capabilities. | - Suitable for **local caching** in **small-scale applications** or tools that do not need distributed caching. <br> - Ideal for **quick caching needs** in standalone applications or libraries. |
| **Redis (via Jedis/Redisson)** | - In-memory data structure store with **persistence** options. <br> - Provides **distributed caching** and **pub/sub messaging**. <br> - Works with Java through libraries like **Jedis** or **Redisson**. | - Best suited for applications that need **high-throughput caching**, **distributed data storage**, or **real-time analytics**. <br> - Suitable for **session management**, **leaderboards**, **distributed locks**, and **message brokering**. |

### Summary of Use Cases:
- **Ehcache** and **Hazelcast** are ideal for **enterprise-level applications** requiring distributed caching and integration with existing tools like **Hibernate**.
- **Caffeine** and **Guava Cache** are suited for **lightweight**, **high-performance local caches** in **non-distributed applications**.
- **Apache Ignite** and **Infinispan** are great choices for **distributed data grids** with **SQL querying** or **transactional support**.
- **Redis** (through Java libraries like **Jedis** or **Redisson**) is useful when **real-time caching** and **distributed** use cases like **session management** are needed.

Each cache library offers strengths for different types of workloads, depending on the complexity of the application and whether it requires **local** or **distributed** caching capabilities.
