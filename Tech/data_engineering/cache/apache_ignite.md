## In Memory Caching
Yes, **Apache Ignite** does provide **in-memory caching** as one of its core functionalities. It is designed as a distributed, **in-memory data grid** that can store and process large datasets across multiple nodes in-memory, leading to fast access and computation.

### Key Features of Apache Ignite's In-Memory Caching:
- **Key-Value Caching**: Like traditional caches, Ignite offers key-value storage in memory, with extremely low latency access.
- **Distributed Caching**: Data is partitioned across nodes in the cluster, which provides horizontal scalability.
- **Near Cache**: Frequently accessed data can be stored locally on the client node to further reduce access time.
- **Data Persistence**: While Apache Ignite primarily works as an in-memory store, it also offers optional **persistence** (native persistence), which allows the cache to store data to disk, combining the benefits of both in-memory speed and disk-backed durability.

Apache Ignite's **in-memory caching** can also be combined with **distributed computing** and **SQL** capabilities, making it a comprehensive platform for both caching and high-performance computing.

So, while Apache Ignite has additional features like distributed computation and persistence, **in-memory caching** is one of its core functionalities.

## SQL Support
Yes, **Apache Ignite** supports **SQL queries**, including **table joins** on in-memory cached data. This means you can perform SQL queries with joins across distributed caches in a manner similar to how you would in a relational database. Apache Ignite's in-memory SQL engine allows you to:

1. **Perform complex SQL joins** between different in-memory tables (caches).
2. **Execute distributed joins** across multiple nodes in the Ignite cluster, which allows for querying large datasets that are partitioned across the cluster.
3. **Use standard SQL syntax**, including `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and other types of joins, to fetch related data from different caches.

### Example:
You can define caches as in-memory tables and use SQL to join them:

```sql
SELECT p.name, o.amount 
FROM Person p 
INNER JOIN Order o 
ON p.id = o.person_id
```

Here, `Person` and `Order` are in-memory caches, and Ignite will handle the join across distributed data nodes.

### Distributed SQL Joins:
Apache Ignite's SQL engine is **ANSI SQL-99 compliant**, allowing for complex queries such as `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, and `AGGREGATIONS`. This distributed SQL engine is designed to handle massive datasets by distributing both storage and query execution across the nodes in the cluster.

### Use Cases:
- **Real-time analytics**: By storing data in-memory and running joins in real-time, you can analyze large, distributed datasets quickly.
- **Fast data access**: Ideal for applications that require complex data querying combined with in-memory speed.

In summary, Apache Ignite can handle SQL table joins efficiently in a distributed, in-memory environment.

## Data Partitioning
**Apache Ignite** does not necessarily replicate the entire table (or cache) across all nodes unless configured to do so. Instead, it typically **partitions** data across nodes in the cluster. This means each node holds only a portion of the data, allowing the cluster to scale horizontally as more nodes are added.

However, Apache Ignite does support two key modes for cache distribution:

1. **Partitioned Mode (default)**:
   - Data is **partitioned** across the cluster, meaning each node stores only a portion of the data.
   - This is highly efficient for large datasets, as it allows horizontal scaling without replicating data on every node.
   - **Joins** are processed across nodes, and Ignite’s distributed SQL engine handles these operations in a way that minimizes data movement.

2. **Replicated Mode**:
   - In this mode, **the entire dataset is replicated** across all nodes in the cluster.
   - This mode is ideal for **read-heavy workloads** where you want to optimize for **faster cache hits** because every node has a full copy of the data.
   - While it provides faster read performance, replicated mode consumes significantly more memory since all nodes store the full dataset.

### Trade-offs:
- **Partitioned Mode** is better suited for large, write-heavy, or mixed workloads where data needs to be distributed across nodes to scale horizontally.
- **Replicated Mode** is useful when low-latency reads are critical, and the data set is small enough to fit into memory on all nodes.

Thus, if you configure **replicated mode**, the entire table will be replicated across all instances, which can result in faster cache hits but at the cost of higher memory consumption. If using **partitioned mode**, only portions of the table will reside on each node, with distributed SQL handling queries and joins across partitions.

## Near Caching
Yes, **Apache Ignite** has a **Near Caching** feature that allows frequently accessed data to be cached closer to the application, typically on the client node. This is particularly useful for reducing network roundtrips and improving access times for data that is frequently queried.

### How Near Caching Works in Apache Ignite:
1. **Local Cache on Client Nodes**: When Near Caching is enabled, frequently accessed data is stored locally on the client node (or even on server nodes in some configurations), reducing the need to fetch it from remote partitions.
   
2. **Automatic Updates**: The cached data is kept up to date by the system. When the primary copy of the data in the main cache (on the server) is updated, the near cache is also automatically updated or invalidated, ensuring data consistency.

3. **Performance Boost**: By caching frequently accessed data on the client side, near caching reduces latency and improves read performance, particularly in read-heavy workloads.

4. **Use Cases**: Near Caching is ideal for use cases where certain data is frequently accessed by an application, such as caching user session data or frequently requested records, allowing for low-latency access.

### Summary of Features:
- Reduces network overhead by keeping frequently accessed data closer to the client.
- Improves performance for read-heavy workloads.
- Automatically synchronized with the main cache for consistency.

In Apache Ignite, Near Caching provides significant performance benefits, especially for distributed applications with frequent data access patterns. This feature is similar to Hazelcast's Near Caching but tailored for Ignite's distributed architecture.

## Ignite Sql Engine
**Apache Ignite** uses a custom-built **SQL engine** that is **ANSI SQL-99 compliant**. This SQL engine allows you to run standard SQL queries on distributed data stored in the Ignite cluster. The engine supports a wide variety of SQL features, such as:

1. **Joins** (including distributed joins across caches),
2. **GROUP BY**, **ORDER BY**, and **aggregate functions**,
3. **Indexes** for fast querying,
4. **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**: `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`,
5. **DDL (Data Definition Language)**: `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`.

### Key Features:
- **Distributed SQL Execution**: SQL queries are executed across all nodes in the cluster, and data is fetched from different partitions as needed.
- **Query Optimization**: The engine includes a query planner and optimizer, which ensures that SQL queries are executed efficiently across the distributed nodes.
- **Full-Text Search**: Ignite's SQL engine supports full-text indexing and search.

Ignite's SQL engine allows it to function similarly to an in-memory database with support for **real-time analytics**, **complex joins**, and **large-scale distributed queries**. It can be used for both **in-memory caching** and **persistent storage** with disk-based persistence. 

For more details, you can refer to [Apache Ignite's documentation](https://ignite.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-querying/sql-introduction).

## Calcite vs Ignite sql engine
The **Apache Ignite SQL engine** and **Apache Calcite** are both SQL engines, but they serve different purposes and architectures, which is why Apache Ignite developed its own SQL engine rather than using Apache Calcite.

### Differences between Ignite SQL Engine and Apache Calcite:

1. **Purpose and Architecture**:
   - **Apache Ignite SQL Engine** is tightly integrated into the distributed, in-memory nature of the Ignite platform. It was designed to perform distributed SQL queries specifically for data stored in Apache Ignite's partitioned caches. It leverages Ignite's **distributed in-memory data grid** for fast querying of both in-memory and on-disk data, allowing for optimized, distributed execution of SQL queries across multiple nodes in a cluster.
   - **Apache Calcite** is a general-purpose **query optimization framework**. It provides query parsing, optimization, and query planning, but it does not include its own storage or execution engine. Instead, Calcite is often used as a SQL parser and optimizer that can be plugged into different storage and execution systems (like Hadoop, Cassandra, or custom data stores).

2. **Execution Layer**:
   - **Ignite’s SQL engine** integrates directly with the **Ignite cache and storage layer**. This allows it to execute SQL queries in a distributed manner, directly interacting with Ignite's partitioned data.
   - **Apache Calcite**, on the other hand, is **storage-agnostic**. It provides a framework to parse and optimize SQL queries but does not have its own execution engine or storage. It can be plugged into any system that needs SQL parsing and optimization, but the actual query execution is delegated to another system.

3. **Optimization and Distribution**:
   - **Ignite's SQL engine** has built-in mechanisms to **distribute SQL queries** across the nodes in the Ignite cluster, handling things like **distributed joins**, **collocated queries**, and **data shuffling** across partitions. The SQL engine is deeply integrated with Ignite’s own partitioning and replication mechanisms.
   - **Apache Calcite** focuses on **query planning and optimization** but requires an external execution layer to handle the distributed nature of the data. Calcite can provide query plans but needs to rely on an underlying system (like Hadoop, Druid, or a custom engine) to perform actual query execution.

4. **Integration with In-Memory Caching**:
   - The **Ignite SQL engine** was specifically built to work seamlessly with Ignite's **in-memory caching layer**, allowing for real-time data processing and querying. It also supports **data persistence** so that queries can be executed against both in-memory and on-disk data.
   - **Apache Calcite** is often used as part of larger ecosystems that might include various storage engines, but it does not have direct integration with in-memory caching systems.

### Why Apache Ignite Didn’t Use Calcite:
While Apache Calcite is a powerful and flexible query optimizer, it wasn't used in Ignite due to the following reasons:
- **Distributed Query Execution**: Ignite needed a tightly integrated query engine that not only optimized queries but also **handled distributed execution across nodes**, which is not the core focus of Calcite.
- **Performance Requirements**: Ignite’s goal of being a high-performance, distributed in-memory data grid required an engine that could work at high speed and low latency. Developing a custom SQL engine allowed for **tailored optimizations** specifically designed for Ignite's distributed nature.
- **Specialized Integration**: Ignite needed the SQL engine to deeply integrate with its **cache, memory management, and storage layers**. This level of integration would be difficult to achieve with a general-purpose framework like Calcite.

In summary, while **Apache Calcite** is a powerful tool for SQL parsing and optimization across different systems, Apache Ignite built its own **SQL engine** to achieve the tight integration required for **distributed query execution** and **in-memory data processing**, ensuring it could meet the high-performance needs of its architecture.
