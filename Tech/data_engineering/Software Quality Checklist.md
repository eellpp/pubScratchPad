A checklist in table format to evaluate the quality of your ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processing system. This checklist covers general software characteristics that are important for ensuring the system is of good quality.

| **Quality Attribute** | **Checklist Item** | **Yes/No** | **Comments/Actions** |
|-----------------------|--------------------|------------|----------------------|
| **Extensibility**     | Can new data sources or transformations be easily added without major changes to the core system? |            |                      |
| **Modularity**        | Is the system divided into independent modules (e.g., extraction, transformation, loading)? |            |                      |
| **Flexibility**       | Can the system easily adapt to different data formats, schemas, and transformation rules? |            |                      |
| **Customization**     | Does the system allow users to configure and customize processing rules and parameters? |            |                      |
| **Scalability**       | Can the system handle increased data volumes and processing workloads efficiently? |            |                      |
| **Maintainability**   | Is the codebase clean, well-documented, and easy to understand and modify? |            |                      |
| **Reliability**       | Does the system consistently process data correctly, even under heavy load or unexpected conditions? |            |                      |
| **Performance**       | Are data processing times within acceptable limits? Have performance bottlenecks been identified and addressed? |            |                      |
| **Security**          | Are there safeguards to protect sensitive data during processing and storage? Are access controls and encryption in place? |            |                      |
| **Usability**         | Is the user interface (if applicable) intuitive and easy to use for configuring and monitoring ETL jobs? |            |                      |
| **Portability**       | Can the system be deployed across different environments (e.g., cloud, on-premises) without significant changes? |            |                      |
| **Interoperability**  | Can the system easily integrate with other tools and systems (e.g., databases, data warehouses, BI tools)? |            |                      |
| **Testability**       | Are there automated tests for validating data transformations and ensuring the correctness of the ETL process? |            |                      |
| **Reusability**       | Can existing components (e.g., transformation functions, connectors) be reused in different ETL pipelines? |            |                      |
| **Availability**      | Is the system designed to minimize downtime and ensure high availability? Are there failover mechanisms in place? |            |                      |
| **Resilience**        | Can the system recover gracefully from failures, such as network interruptions or data corruption? |            |                      |
| **Modifiability**     | Can changes be made to the system with minimal impact on other components? Is the system designed with changeability in mind? |            |                      |
| **Compliance**        | Does the system comply with relevant regulations and standards (e.g., data privacy laws, industry standards)? |            |                      |
| **Auditability**      | Can the system provide detailed logs and reports of data processing activities for auditing purposes? |            |                      |
| **Integrity**         | Are data validation checks in place to ensure data accuracy and consistency throughout the ETL process? |            |                      |
| **Backward Compatibility** | Can the system work with older data formats or versions without requiring major changes? |            |                      |

### Instructions for Use:
- **Yes/No Column**: For each checklist item, mark "Yes" if the characteristic is met or "No" if it is not. 
- **Comments/Actions Column**: Use this space to provide additional comments, note any issues, or outline actions needed to address shortcomings.

This checklist provides a structured way to assess the quality of your ETL processing system, helping ensure it meets key software quality attributes and is robust, maintainable, and scalable.
