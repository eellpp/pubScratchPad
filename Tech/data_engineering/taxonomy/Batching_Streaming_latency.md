While there isnâ€™t a strict industry-wide standard for defining specific latency thresholds for batch, micro-batch, and streaming jobs, some general guidelines are widely recognized based on latency needs and the nature of the data.

1. **Batch Processing** typically handles high latency requirements, as data is collected over extended periods and processed in bulk. Latency in batch processing can range from minutes to hours or even days, making it ideal for scenarios that don't need real-time insights, like monthly reporting or large ETL operations

2. **Micro-Batch Processing** serves as a middle ground, breaking data into smaller batches processed at frequent intervals (often seconds to minutes). This approach is popular in scenarios that require near-real-time data, like periodic updates for dashboards or quick-response analytics, where some latency (seconds to minutes) is acceptable but needs to be lower than typical batch processing

3. **Stream Processing** (also known as real-time processing) aims for the lowest latency, often in milliseconds to a few seconds. This approach processes each data point as it arrives, enabling immediate action on high-speed data streams, which is essential for applications like fraud detection, social media monitoring, and real-time financial transactions

These latency definitions help organizations decide on the appropriate processing approach based on the immediacy of insights needed, infrastructure requirements, and specific use cases.
