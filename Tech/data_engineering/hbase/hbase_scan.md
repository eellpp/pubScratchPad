### Scan table with Hbase

Import the necessary HBase libraries into your Java code. This includes the HBase Configuration and HTable libraries. You can do this with the following code:

```python

import org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration;
import org.apache.hadoop.hbase.HBaseConfiguration;
import org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.Result;
import org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.ResultScanner;
import org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.Scan;
import org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.Table;
import org.apache.hadoop.hbase.util.Bytes;
```

Create a Configuration object that contains the HBase configuration settings. You can do this with the following code:
```lua
Configuration config = HBaseConfiguration.create();
```

Connect to the HBase table that you want to scan using the Table object. You can do this with the following code:

```less
Table table = connection.getTable(TableName.valueOf("your_table_name"));
```

Create a Scan object that specifies the columns and filters that you want to include in the scan. For example, if you want to scan all rows in the table, you can create a scan object with the following code:
```java

Scan scan = new Scan();
```

If you want to include filters to limit the results, you can add them to the scan object. For example, if you want to only include rows with a certain value in a particular column, you can add a filter with the following code:

```less
scan.setFilter(new SingleColumnValueFilter(Bytes.toBytes("column_family"), Bytes.toBytes("column"), CompareOp.EQUAL, Bytes.toBytes("value")));
```
Create a ResultScanner object to execute the scan and retrieve the results. You can do this with the following code:
```java

ResultScanner scanner = table.getScanner(scan);
```
Iterate over the results using a for loop and retrieve the data you want from each row. For example, if you want to retrieve the value of a specific column, you can use the following code:
```less

for (Result result = scanner.next(); result != null; result = scanner.next()) {
    byte[] value = result.getValue(Bytes.toBytes("column_family"), Bytes.toBytes("column"));
    System.out.println(Bytes.toString(value));
}
```
Close the ResultScanner and Table objects to free up resources. You can do this with the following code:
```lua

scanner.close();
table.close();
```
That's it! With these steps, you should be able to scan an HBase table in Java.
