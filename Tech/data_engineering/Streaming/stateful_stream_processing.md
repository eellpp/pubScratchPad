Stateful stream processing tools are platforms or frameworks that allow the processing of continuous streams of data while maintaining state information across multiple events in the stream. These tools are essential in scenarios where understanding the history or cumulative results of the data is necessary, such as detecting trends, aggregating data, or maintaining counters.

### Key Features of Stateful Stream Processing:
- **State Management:** These tools keep track of intermediate results, counters, or aggregations across different events in the stream, allowing the application to maintain context.
- **Fault Tolerance:** They are designed to recover from failures by restoring state from checkpoints or logs without losing or duplicating data.
- **Windowing:** They support processing events over a specific period (time windows) or a number of events (count windows), which is crucial for aggregations, joins, and computations on chunks of data.
- **Low Latency:** These tools are optimized for processing data in real-time with low latency while maintaining correctness.

### Examples of Stateful Stream Processing Tools:

#### 1. **Apache Flink**
   - **Description:** Apache Flink is a powerful, open-source stream processing framework that offers robust support for both **stateless** and **stateful** stream processing. Flink is known for its ability to process both bounded and unbounded streams, and its rich support for state management, windowing, and event time processing.
   - **Key Features:**
     - Native support for stateful computations.
     - State is stored locally within the application, but it can be backed up to a distributed storage system (e.g., HDFS, RocksDB) for fault tolerance.
     - Offers strong consistency guarantees through distributed snapshotting (checkpointing) and recovery.
     - Supports complex event processing, aggregations, and joins across streams.
   - **Use Cases:** Fraud detection, real-time analytics, dynamic pricing, machine learning models on streams.

#### 2. **Apache Kafka Streams**
   - **Description:** Kafka Streams is a lightweight library that provides stream processing capabilities on top of Apache Kafka. It is designed to be easy to integrate into Java applications and allows for stateful processing.

     - Provides a unified programming model for batch and stream processing.
     - Supports stateful transformations such as aggregations over time windows, event time processing, and join operations.
     - Uses memory and disk to maintain state, with checkpointing for fault tolerance.
     - Integrates with various data sources like Kafka, HDFS, Amazon S3, etc.
   - **Use Cases:** Real-time dashboarding, fraud detection, live data monitoring.

#### 5. **Google Cloud Dataflow**
   - **Description:** Google Cloud Dataflow is a fully managed service for stream and batch data processing based on Apache Beam. It supports stateful processing through Apache Beam’s unified model.
   - **Key Features:**
