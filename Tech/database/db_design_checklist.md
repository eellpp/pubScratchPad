Here is a checklist of key questions to ask before deciding on the database design, categorized based on the requirements of concurrency, latency, throughput, and other factors:

---

### **1. General Requirements**

- **What is the primary purpose of the database?**
  - OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) for handling day-to-day operations, or OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) for analytics?
  
- **What is the expected scale of data?**
  - How much data will be stored (e.g., gigabytes, terabytes, petabytes)?
  - What is the expected growth rate of the data?

- **What is the expected number of users?**
  - How many concurrent users will be accessing the database at peak times?

---

### **2. Concurrency**

- **What is the expected level of concurrency?**
  - How many reads and writes will be performed simultaneously?
  
- **Will the database need to handle many concurrent writes, or is it read-heavy?**
  - Are read/write operations evenly distributed, or is one operation significantly more frequent?

- **Does the system require pessimistic or optimistic locking?**
  - Will you use a mechanism to prevent concurrent writes (pessimistic) or handle potential conflicts (optimistic)?

- **How will you handle transaction management and isolation?**
  - Do you require strict ACID compliance, or is eventual consistency acceptable?

---

### **3. Latency**

- **What is the acceptable latency for reads and writes?**
  - Are there real-time processing requirements, or is some delay acceptable?

- **Will you need low-latency data access?**
  - Will in-memory databases or caching mechanisms be needed to meet latency requirements?

- **Is there a need for real-time data analytics or processing?**
  - Will you be performing real-time analytics on live data streams?

---

### **4. Throughput**

- **What is the expected write throughput?**
  - How many write operations are expected per second/minute/hour?

- **What is the expected read throughput?**
  - How many reads will happen concurrently, and what’s the expected read volume?

- **Will you need to optimize for high write throughput, high read throughput, or both?**
  - Is it essential to optimize the database design for one specific operation (reads or writes), or do both need to be balanced?

- **Will batch processing be required for high-write scenarios?**
  - Will bulk writes be processed periodically, or is the system more transactional?

---

### **5. Data Consistency and Availability**

- **What level of data consistency is required?**
  - Does the application require strict consistency (ACID), or can it tolerate eventual consistency (CAP theorem)?

- **How critical is availability?**
  - Can the system tolerate some downtime, or does it need to be highly available (e.g., 99.99% uptime)?

- **Do you need fault tolerance and failover support?**
  - Should the database automatically failover in case of hardware failures?

- **Is geographic distribution of data required for global availability?**
  - Do you need multi-region replication to ensure global data access and availability?

---

### **6. Data Structure and Schema Design**

- **What type of data will be stored?**
  - Is the data structured (relational), semi-structured (JSON, XML), or unstructured (documents, media files)?

- **How complex is the data model?**
  - Will the data model involve many relationships and joins (e.g., normalized relational design) or simple document storage (e.g., NoSQL)?

- **How often will the schema change?**
  - Is the schema expected to evolve frequently, requiring flexibility in how the data is stored?

- **Will you need schema flexibility (NoSQL) or a structured schema (SQL)?**
  - Can the schema be fixed upfront, or is schema-less or semi-structured storage more appropriate?

---

### **7. Read/Write Balance**

- **What is the read-to-write ratio?**
  - Are there more read-heavy queries, or is the system write-intensive?

- **Will the system require frequent joins between tables?**
  - Are complex queries and joins essential, or are they avoided in favor of denormalized data?

- **Do you need caching mechanisms to offload read-heavy queries?**
  - Would caching frequently accessed data (e.g., with **Redis** or **Memcached**) improve performance?

- **Are read operations latency-sensitive?**
  - How fast do read operations need to be completed?

---

### **8. Scalability**

- **How will the system scale over time?**
  - Is the system expected to scale vertically (more powerful machines) or horizontally (more machines)?

- **Is horizontal scalability critical for growth?**
  - Will the database need to scale across multiple nodes or regions?

- **What are the performance expectations as the dataset grows?**
  - How will the database handle large datasets over time (e.g., partitioning, sharding, archiving)?

---

### **9. Security and Compliance**

- **What security mechanisms need to be in place?**
  - Will encryption, role-based access control (RBAC), or auditing be required?

- **Are there any compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)?**
  - Does the system need to meet regulatory requirements for data protection and privacy?

- **Will the database need to store sensitive information (e.g., personally identifiable information)?**
  - If yes, how will you ensure that this data is protected both at rest and in transit?

---

### **10. Maintenance and Operations**

- **How will backups and disaster recovery be handled?**
  - What backup strategies and recovery point objectives (RPO) and recovery time objectives (RTO) are needed?

- **What are the operational constraints (e.g., support, downtime)?**
  - How much downtime can be tolerated for maintenance or upgrades?

- **Is automated scaling and provisioning needed?**
  - Does the database need to automatically scale up or down based on demand?

---

### **11. Technology Preferences**

- **Do you have any specific database technology preferences (SQL vs. NoSQL)?**
  - Are there any organizational standards or expertise that favor relational databases (e.g., **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**) or NoSQL solutions (e.g., **MongoDB**, **Cassandra**)?

- **What level of support is required (managed vs. self-managed)?**
  - Do you prefer a managed database service (e.g., **Amazon RDS**, **Azure Cosmos DB**) or to self-manage the infrastructure?

---

### **12. Analytics and Reporting**

- **Will you be running complex analytical queries?**
  - Are complex aggregations, reporting, and analytical queries part of the system’s requirements?

- **Do you need real-time analytics?**
  - Will real-time data analytics be necessary, or is it more of a batch process (OLAP)?

- **Will you need to store time-series data or event logs?**
  - Is the data time-based (e.g., time-series for IoT or log data)?

---

### **13. Cost Considerations**

- **What is the budget for the database infrastructure?**
  - Are there cost constraints that might limit certain database technologies or architectures?

- **How will storage and compute costs evolve as the data scales?**
  - Can the system handle growing costs associated with scaling out data storage and compute resources?

By asking these questions before designing your database, you can ensure that the chosen database solution aligns with the system’s performance, scalability, security, and operational requirements. These questions will help clarify whether the design should favor SQL or NoSQL, whether denormalization or normalization is better, and what kind of partitioning, indexing, and replication strategies are appropriate for your use case.
