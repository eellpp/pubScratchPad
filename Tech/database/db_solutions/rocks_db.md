>> ClickHouse employs a rule-based optimizer, which decides based on a predefined set of rules or heuristics. It has limited regard for actual data distribution, focusing mainly on basic metrics like file size or row count. Rule-based optimizers can suffice for uncomplicated queries, but they might not be ideal for OLAP workloads.


>> In contrast, StarRocks utilizes a cost-based optimizer that gathers statistics, estimates plan costs, and applies a greedy algorithm to select the most efficient plan. This optimizer is an intrinsic part of StarRocks, deeply integrated with its execution and storage layers. Optimizer development is a complex endeavor, demanding multiple iterations, especially in open-source projects like StarRocks.

>> We covered broadcast join, shuffle join, bucket shuffle join, co-located join, and replicated join. Replicated join, a precomputed broadcast join, duplicates the right table onto every node during data ingestion, utilizing storage. Without shuffling capabilities, ClickHouse's only options are to either predetermine your query pattern and distribute data accordingly for co-located or replicated joins or use broadcast join for smaller right tables. In scenarios where both tables are vast, shuffling is imperative, lest you experience bottlenecks from single node limitations.


### To conclude, let's compare StarRocks and ClickHouse:

1. StarRocks supports on-the-fly joins, while ClickHouse requires complex denormalization data pipelines.

2. For query planning, StarRocks uses a cost-based optimizer, whereas ClickHouse relies on a rule-based optimizer.

3. StarRocks has further optimizations for joins, such as the global runtime filter. To learn more about this filter, you can watch a demo on the CelerData YouTube channel.

4. In terms of compute architecture, StarRocks supports data shuffling, allowing it to handle diverse joins â€“ whether it's a big table with a small one, two large tables, or multiple big tables combined. ClickHouse, however, due to its architectural constraints, can't support these scenarios.
