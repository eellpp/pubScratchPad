A **materialized view** is a database object that stores the result of a query in a physical, precomputed form, unlike a regular view, which is a virtual table generated dynamically at query time. This makes materialized views particularly useful for improving the performance of complex or expensive queries, such as aggregations or joins, by allowing you to query the precomputed result set rather than executing the underlying query each time.

### Key Characteristics of Materialized Views:

1. **Physical Storage**: 
   - Materialized views store the query result as a physical table. This contrasts with standard views, which only store the query logic and execute it on the fly when accessed.
   
2. **Refresh Mechanism**:
   - Materialized views need to be **refreshed** to keep the data up to date with the underlying base tables. The refresh can be done **manually** or **automatically** at scheduled intervals.
   - **Full refresh**: The entire view is recomputed from scratch.
   - **Incremental (Fast) refresh**: Only the changes since the last refresh (deltas) are applied to update the view.

3. **Improved Query Performance**:
   - Since the result of the materialized view is precomputed, querying it is much faster, especially for complex queries involving joins, aggregations, or large datasets.

4. **Use Cases**:
   - Frequently queried data that is computationally expensive to generate (e.g., sales reports, analytics, aggregations).
   - Data that does not change frequently or where slight delays in updates are acceptable (i.e., eventually consistent).
   - Real-time dashboards or applications where query performance is critical.

### When to Use Materialized Views:

1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Materialized views are helpful when you need to optimize query performance for complex queries that are slow or resource-intensive (e.g., involving joins, aggregations, or filtering large datasets).
   - They are ideal when the underlying data does not change frequently, and you can tolerate a slight delay between data updates and when the materialized view is refreshed.

2. **Aggregations**:
   - They are commonly used for storing precomputed aggregates like `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, or `GROUP BY` results, reducing the need for repeated recalculation during query execution.

3. **Data Warehousing**:
   - Materialized views are commonly used in **data warehouses** to optimize the performance of analytical queries (OLAP workloads). In these cases, materialized views can store aggregated data (e.g., sales by region, monthly totals) that is queried frequently.

4. **Summary Tables**:
   - Materialized views are often used as **summary tables** that provide precomputed views of data, such as monthly or yearly summaries, making them quick to query.

### How Materialized Views Work:

- **Creation**:
  A materialized view is created using a SQL `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` statement, which defines the query whose result will be stored. For example:
  ```sql
  CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW sales_summary AS
  SELECT product_id, SUM(quantity_sold) AS total_sales
  FROM sales
  GROUP BY product_id;
  ```

- **Querying**:
  When you query a materialized view, the database fetches the result directly from the stored data rather than re-executing the underlying query.
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM sales_summary;
  ```

- **Refresh**:
  Materialized views can be refreshed to update the stored results when the underlying data changes. In databases like **PostgreSQL**, this can be done manually:
  ```sql
  REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW sales_summary;
  ```
  Some databases allow for automatic refresh schedules or incremental refresh.

### Benefits of Materialized Views:

1. **Improved Query Performance**:
   - Queries on large datasets or complex operations like joins, aggregations, and window functions run much faster because the result is precomputed and stored.

2. **Reduced Load on Base Tables**:
   - By storing precomputed data, you reduce the load on the underlying tables, especially when the query is run frequently.

3. **Efficiency in Reporting and Analytics**:
   - Materialized views are particularly useful in data warehousing environments where reporting and analytical queries are resource-intensive. The precomputed results provide quicker response times for business intelligence queries.

---

### Limitations of Materialized Views:

1. **Staleness**:
   - The data in a materialized view is only as fresh as the last refresh. If the underlying data changes frequently, there may be a time lag before those changes are reflected in the view, leading to **stale data**.

2. **Maintenance Overhead**:
   - Regularly refreshing a materialized view, especially on large datasets, can be resource-intensive. The database needs to recompute or apply changes to the view periodically, which can impact performance during refresh operations.

3. **Storage Cost**:
   - Since materialized views physically store data, they consume additional storage space. This can become a concern when managing large datasets.

### Example Use Case:

Let's say you're managing a large e-commerce platform, and you need to frequently generate reports on total sales for each product. Calculating total sales involves scanning millions of rows in the `sales` table and performing an aggregation.

Instead of calculating this on-the-fly each time a report is generated, you can create a materialized view that precomputes the total sales for each product. This way, the query response time is much faster:

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW product_sales_summary AS
SELECT product_id, SUM(amount) AS total_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY product_id;
```

You can refresh the materialized view periodically (e.g., daily) to keep the data up to date without impacting performance during query execution.

### Conclusion:

A **materialized view** is a powerful tool for improving the performance of read-heavy analytical queries by storing the precomputed results of complex queries. It reduces the need for real-time computation of expensive queries but requires careful management of refresh schedules and storage. They are especially useful in scenarios like reporting, data warehousing, and preaggregating large datasets for faster querying.

# **Materialized view** VS  **Precomputed joins and aggregations**

A **materialized view** is related to **precomputed joins and aggregations**, but they are not exactly the same. Let’s break down the similarities and differences:

### **Materialized Views:**
A **materialized view** is a database object that stores the **precomputed results** of a query, which can involve joins, aggregations, or any other complex SQL operations. The key point is that a materialized view stores the result physically on disk, allowing fast retrieval without re-executing the underlying query each time.

### **Precomputed Joins and Aggregations:**
**Precomputed joins and aggregations** refer to the process of calculating the result of joins and aggregations in advance and storing the outcome in a separate table or structure. This concept overlaps with what materialized views do, but it's more general and can be implemented in different ways.

---

### **Key Similarities:**
1. **Precomputed Results**:
   - Both materialized views and precomputed joins/aggregations store the result of a query ahead of time to improve performance.
   - In both cases, the database or application retrieves the precomputed data instead of performing the join or aggregation on the fly.

2. **Performance Boost**:
   - Both approaches aim to **reduce query execution time** by avoiding repeated computation of expensive operations like joins and aggregations during query time.

3. **Reduced Computational Overhead**:
   - Instead of recalculating complex operations each time a query is run, both methods allow you to store the result and update it periodically, reducing the computational burden on the database.

### **Key Differences:**

| **Materialized View** | **Precomputed Joins/Aggregations** |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Automated in the Database**: The materialized view is a database feature that allows automatic storage and management of precomputed data. The database manages the query result, refresh, and access to the materialized view. | **Manual Implementation**: Precomputed joins and aggregations can be manually implemented by creating separate tables or views with the desired precomputed data. The developer or DBA manages the creation, refreshing, and usage of these tables. |
| **Dynamic Queries**: Materialized views can be built from any query, not just joins or aggregations. You can create materialized views for filtering, complex expressions, window functions, etc. | **Focused on Joins and Aggregations**: The term “precomputed joins and aggregations” is specific to precomputing these two types of operations. While it's similar to a materialized view, it is usually used in the context of optimizing these specific operations. |
| **Automatic Refreshing**: Most databases allow you to refresh a materialized view periodically or incrementally (e.g., `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` in PostgreSQL). This can be done manually or set up as part of the database's internal scheduling. | **Manual Refreshing**: If you're manually precomputing joins and aggregations, you are responsible for creating ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines or batch jobs to refresh the precomputed data. |
| **Database-Managed Storage**: The materialized view is managed entirely by the database. It acts like a virtual table, and the database takes care of storing the data and making it queryable. | **Manually Created Tables**: In manual precomputed join or aggregation approaches, you typically create a separate table where the results are stored and managed by your application or ETL pipeline. |
| **Integration with the Query Optimizer**: Many databases can automatically decide when to use a materialized view based on the query being run. The database optimizer may choose to use the materialized view instead of executing the base query. | **Explicit Querying**: With manually precomputed joins/aggregations, you typically need to explicitly query the precomputed table. The database will not automatically use it unless you specifically direct your query to the precomputed table. |

### **When to Use Materialized Views vs. Precomputed Joins/Aggregations:**

- **Materialized View:**
  - Use when you want the database to manage the complexity of storing, refreshing, and accessing precomputed data.
  - Suitable for complex queries involving not only joins and aggregations but also filtering, sorting, window functions, and more.
  - Ideal when you want automated or scheduled refreshing of precomputed data without needing to manually manage tables or ETL pipelines.

- **Precomputed Joins and Aggregations (Manual Implementation):**
  - Use when you need full control over the data precomputation and refresh logic (e.g., using custom ETL jobs or batch processes).
  - Suitable for specific cases where you're primarily optimizing join-heavy or aggregation-heavy queries and want to manually manage data storage and refresh intervals.
  - Ideal in systems where the application layer manages the database, and you need custom refresh strategies based on business logic or operational constraints.

---

### **Conclusion:**

- **Materialized Views** provide a database-native way to store precomputed results, including joins, aggregations, and other query operations. They are managed and refreshed by the database, making them an easy-to-use solution for improving query performance.
  
- **Precomputed Joins and Aggregations**, while conceptually similar, refer more broadly to the practice of manually creating tables with precomputed data. This approach gives you more control over how and when the data is refreshed but requires manual management.

Both approaches aim to solve the same fundamental problem: reducing the computational cost of expensive queries by precomputing results. However, materialized views are a more structured and automated solution offered by databases, while precomputed joins and aggregations can be part of a custom data pipeline or architecture.
