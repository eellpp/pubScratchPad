### **Explanation of Key Terms and Strategies in the Table:**

1. **Cost-Based Optimizer (CBO)**: This optimizer evaluates multiple execution plans and selects the one with the lowest estimated "cost," considering factors like CPU, memory, I/O, and data size. CBOs are generally more sophisticated and suitable for complex queries.
   
2. **Rule-Based Optimizer (RBO)**: This optimizer uses predefined rules and heuristics to choose the execution plan. It's typically simpler and faster than CBOs but may not handle complex queries as efficiently.

3. **Parallel Execution**: Databases supporting parallel execution can distribute query processing across multiple CPU cores, nodes, or clusters, speeding up query execution for large datasets.

4. **Columnar Storage**: Databases like **BigQuery**, **ClickHouse**, and **Druid** store data in a columnar format, allowing for efficient read access for analytical queries because only the relevant columns are scanned.

5. **Materialized Views**: These are precomputed views that store the result of a query, making repeated queries faster because the database does not have to recompute the results from raw data.

6. **Partition Pruning**: This technique reduces the amount of data scanned by excluding irrelevant partitions based on query filters.

7. **Sharding/Partitioning**: Data is distributed across multiple nodes or partitions, improving scalability and enabling faster access to data by limiting the amount of data each node has to process.

8. **In-Memory Processing**: Databases like **Redis**, **Flink**, and **MongoDB** with in-memory options allow faster data access by reducing the need to read from disk.

### **Conclusion:**

Different databases have unique strategies for planning and executing queries, with each database optimized for specific use cases such as OLAP (analytical), OLTP (transactional), real-time streaming, or document storage. By understanding the planner and execution engine choices of each database, you can select the right database for your workload, whether you need high concurrency, low-latency read/write operations, or efficient large-scale analytical queries.
