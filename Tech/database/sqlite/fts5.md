FTS5 is an SQLite virtual table module that provides full-text search functionality to database applications.  


An external content FTS5 table is created by setting the content option to the name of a table, virtual table within the same database.    
Whenever column values are required by FTS5, it queries the content table, with the rowid of the row for which values are required bound to the SQL variable:  

```bash
-- Create a table. And an external content fts5 table to index it.
CREATE TABLE tbl(a INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, b, c);
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE fts_idx USING fts5(b, c, content='tbl', content_rowid='a');

-- Triggers to keep the FTS index up to date.
CREATE TRIGGER tbl_ai AFTER INSERT ON tbl BEGIN
  INSERT INTO fts_idx(rowid, b, c) VALUES (new.a, new.b, new.c);
END;
CREATE TRIGGER tbl_ad AFTER DELETE ON tbl BEGIN
  INSERT INTO fts_idx(fts_idx, rowid, b, c) VALUES('delete', old.a, old.b, old.c);
END;
CREATE TRIGGER tbl_au AFTER UPDATE ON tbl BEGIN
  INSERT INTO fts_idx(fts_idx, rowid, b, c) VALUES('delete', old.a, old.b, old.c);
  INSERT INTO fts_idx(rowid, b, c) VALUES (new.a, new.b, new.c);
END;
```
