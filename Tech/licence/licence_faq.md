### If I use a Java library that has GPL v1, am I required to make the app open sourced?
If you use a Java library that is licensed under GPL v1 (GNU General Public License version 1), you are required to make your app open-source under the same GPL v1 license if you distribute the app. Here’s why:

1. GPL v1 and Copyleft

	•	GPL v1 is a strong copyleft license, much like GPL v2 and GPL v3, which means that if you use a GPL v1-licensed library in your application and distribute the application, the entire application is considered a derivative work.
	•	Under the terms of GPL v1, when you distribute your application, you must make it available under GPL v1 as well. This includes providing the source code and allowing others to modify and redistribute the application under the same terms.

2. Distribution Requirement

	•	The key point is that the copyleft obligation applies if you distribute the software. If you are distributing an application that uses a GPL v1-licensed library, you are required to release the source code of your entire application under GPL v1.
	•	This means you must allow others to view, modify, and redistribute your code under the GPL v1 license.

3. Key Considerations with GPL v1

	•	Combining Code: If you link or combine your code with a GPL v1-licensed library, your entire application must be licensed under GPL v1 if you distribute it. This copyleft applies not just to the library itself but to the entire application that uses it.
	•	Derivative Works: Any modifications or derivative works that incorporate a GPL v1-licensed library must also be open-sourced under GPL v1.

4. What If You Don’t Distribute the App?

	•	If you are using the GPL v1-licensed library internally (within your organization) or for personal use without distributing the application to others, you are not required to open-source your application. The copyleft requirement is triggered only when you distribute the software.

5. GPL v1 vs. Later Versions (GPL v2, v3)

	•	While GPL v1 is less commonly used today (most projects have moved to GPL v2 or GPL v3), the principles of copyleft remain consistent across all versions of the GPL. The primary difference with GPL v2 and v3 is the handling of legal protections, patent clauses, and certain technical clarifications, but the core copyleft obligation remains the same.
	•	Unlike later versions (like GPL v2 with Classpath Exception), GPL v1 does not have exceptions for linking, which means any software that uses or links to a GPL v1 library will be subject to the same licensing obligations.

Summary:

	•	Yes, if you use a Java library that is licensed under GPL v1, you are required to make your application open-source under GPL v1 if you distribute it.
	•	If you are not distributing the application, you can keep the code closed-source and proprietary.
	•	The copyleft obligation applies to the entire application when a GPL v1 library is used, meaning the whole app must be released under GPL v1.

In most cases, developers today encounter GPL v2 or GPL v3 licenses, as GPL v1 is much less common. However, the requirement to open-source your code when using GPL v1-licensed libraries remains similar to later versions.

### If use a Java library that has GPL v2, am I required to make the app open sourced?
Whether you are required to make your application open-sourced when using a Java library licensed under GPL v2 depends on whether the library is licensed with the Classpath Exception or not. Here’s a detailed explanation:

1. GPL v2 Without the Classpath Exception

	•	GPL v2 (GNU General Public License version 2) is a strong copyleft license, similar to GPL v3, which means that if you distribute a software application that is linked to or contains a GPL v2 library, your entire application must also be released under the GPL v2 license.
	•	If the library is licensed under GPL v2 without any exceptions (such as the Classpath Exception), then:
	•	Yes, you are required to make your application open-source and distribute it under the same GPL v2 license if you distribute the application. This is because any software that links to or incorporates a GPL v2-licensed library becomes a derivative work, and the copyleft obligations apply.

2. GPL v2 with the Classpath Exception (Common for Java Libraries)

	•	Many Java libraries (such as OpenJDK) are licensed under GPL v2 with the Classpath Exception.
	•	The Classpath Exception is a special condition that exempts your application from being bound by the GPL v2 copyleft requirements. This means that you can link to or use the GPL v2-licensed library without having to release your entire application under the GPL v2 license.
	•	Specifically, the Classpath Exception allows you to use the library in your proprietary, non-GPL applications, provided that your application does not directly modify the GPL-licensed library itself. In this case, you are not required to make your application open-source.

Example of Classpath Exception Text:

	“As a special exception, you may link this library with independent modules to produce an executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that module.”

	•	For Java libraries, GPL v2 with the Classpath Exception is common because it allows developers to use the library without worrying about the open-source licensing of their own software. This is the licensing model used by OpenJDK.

3. Summary of Key Scenarios

	•	GPL v2 without Classpath Exception:
	•	If you use a library licensed under plain GPL v2 (without any exceptions), yes, you are required to make your entire application open-source under the same GPL v2 license if you distribute the application.
	•	This would mean that if your app uses or links to the GPL v2 library, the copyleft requirements apply to your entire codebase, not just the parts that interact with the GPL v2 library.
	•	GPL v2 with Classpath Exception:
	•	If the library includes the Classpath Exception, then no, you are not required to make your application open-source. The Classpath Exception allows you to link the GPL v2 library with your application without imposing the GPL v2 copyleft on the entire application.
	•	This is common for many Java libraries, where the exception is explicitly included to allow proprietary and non-GPL applications to use the library without having to be open-sourced.

4. Real-World Example: OpenJDK

	•	OpenJDK is licensed under GPL v2 with Classpath Exception, allowing developers to use OpenJDK in both open-source and proprietary projects without needing to release their entire codebase under the GPL.
	•	Without the Classpath Exception, using OpenJDK would normally require that any software using it also be licensed under the GPL v2, but thanks to the exception, this is not the case for Java applications using OpenJDK.

Conclusion:

	•	If the Java library is licensed under plain GPL v2: You must open-source your application under GPL v2 if you distribute it.
	•	If the Java library is licensed under GPL v2 with the Classpath Exception: You are not required to open-source your application, and you can use the library in proprietary software.

When using a GPL v2 library, always check if it includes the Classpath Exception in its license. This will determine whether you can use it freely in closed-source or proprietary applications without being subject to the GPL’s copyleft requirements.

### If I use a Java library that has GPL v3, am I required to make the app open sourced?

Yes, if you use a Java library that is licensed under GPL v3 (GNU General Public License version 3), you are required to comply with the terms of the GPL v3 license, which generally includes making your application open-source under the same license (GPL v3) if you distribute it.

Here’s a breakdown of what this means:

1. GPL v3 and Copyleft

	•	GPL v3 is a strong copyleft license. This means that any derivative work or software that includes or links to a GPL v3-licensed library must also be released under GPL v3 if distributed.
	•	You are required to provide source code of your application under GPL v3 if you distribute the application (whether it’s distributed publicly or privately to others). This applies to both the library and your entire application, meaning anyone receiving your software can modify and redistribute it under the same license.

2. Key Obligations under GPL v3:

	•	Distribution: If you distribute the software (including internally in a company or to external users), you must provide the source code and allow others to modify and redistribute it under the same terms.
	•	Derived Works: If your application links to or includes a GPL v3 library, it is considered a derivative work, and the entire application must be licensed under GPL v3 if it is distributed.
	•	Modifications: Any changes you make to the GPL v3 library must also be open-sourced and provided under the same license.

3. What If You Don’t Distribute the Application?

	•	If you do not distribute the application and keep it for personal use or internal use within your organization (with no distribution outside), you are not required to release the source code. The GPL v3 license’s copyleft obligations only apply if you distribute the software to others.

4. Dynamic Linking and GPL v3

	•	Some developers try to avoid GPL v3 obligations by dynamically linking to a GPL v3 library instead of statically linking it. However, the FSF (Free Software Foundation) considers both static and dynamic linking to GPL-licensed code as creating a derivative work, meaning it still triggers the copyleft requirement if you distribute the application.

5. GPL-Compatible Licenses

	•	If you combine a GPL v3 library with other libraries in your app, the entire work must be compatible with GPL v3. You cannot combine it with non-GPL-compatible licenses (like proprietary licenses) unless those components are independently separable and do not form a single combined program.

6. Exceptions or Alternatives (GPL v3 with Classpath Exception)

	•	Some GPL licenses, such as GPL v2 with Classpath Exception (used by OpenJDK), explicitly allow linking to the library without imposing GPL obligations on the rest of the application. However, GPL v3 does not have such exceptions unless explicitly stated by the author of the library. If you are using a library with GPL v3 with an exception clause, it may allow you to link to it without making your application open-source.

Summary:

	•	Yes, if you use a GPL v3-licensed library in your app and you distribute that app, you will be required to release your entire application under the GPL v3 license and make it open-source.
	•	If you only use the app for personal use or internal use without distribution, you are not required to open-source it.
	•	Be cautious of the distinction between GPL v3 and other GPL variants, such as GPL v2 with the Classpath Exception, which might allow more flexibility.

If you don’t want to open-source your app, you would need to either avoid using GPL v3 libraries or find libraries under a more permissive license like MIT, Apache 2.0, or GPL v2 with Classpath Exception.
