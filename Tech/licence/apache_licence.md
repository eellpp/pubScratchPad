Apache projects use the Apache License 2.0. This is a widely used, permissive open-source license that is designed to be business-friendly and to encourage the adoption of open-source software. The Apache License 2.0 is maintained by the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) and is used by all official Apache projects as well as many non-Apache projects.

Key Features of the Apache License 2.0:

	1.	Permissive License:
	•	The Apache License 2.0 allows users of the software (individuals or organizations) to use, modify, distribute, and even incorporate the code into proprietary software.
	•	There are no copyleft requirements like the GPL, meaning you are not required to open-source your own code if you use an Apache-licensed library.
	2.	Attribution Requirement:
	•	While you can use Apache-licensed software in your project, including in proprietary software, you must include a copy of the Apache License and any applicable notices (like copyright and attribution) in your software distribution.
	•	This includes maintaining any NOTICE files that accompany the Apache project, providing credit to the original authors and contributors.
	3.	Patent Grant:
	•	The Apache License 2.0 provides an explicit patent grant, which means that contributors to the project agree to grant users of the software a royalty-free, worldwide, non-exclusive license to use any patents that may cover the contribution.
	•	This patent clause offers legal protection for users of Apache-licensed software, allowing them to use it without fear of patent litigation from contributors.
	4.	No Strong Copyleft:
	•	Unlike the GPL (GNU General Public License), which requires derivative works to be released under the same license (copyleft), the Apache License 2.0 allows you to use Apache-licensed code in proprietary or commercial software without requiring you to open-source your application.
	•	This makes the license more flexible and attractive for businesses that want to use open-source code without exposing their proprietary code.
	5.	Compatibility with Other Licenses:
	•	Apache License 2.0 is compatible with many other open-source licenses, including permissive licenses like the MIT License and BSD License.
	•	However, it is not compatible with GPL v2, meaning you cannot combine Apache 2.0-licensed code with GPL v2-licensed code in the same project without violating one of the licenses. It is, however, compatible with GPL v3.

Summary of What You Can Do with Apache License 2.0 Software:

	•	Use the software freely for any purpose, including commercial use.
	•	Modify the software to suit your needs.
	•	Distribute the software, either in its original form or with modifications.
	•	Include the software in proprietary products, as long as you adhere to the attribution and notice requirements.

Example Projects Using the Apache License 2.0:

	•	Apache Hadoop (Big Data framework)
	•	Apache Kafka (Distributed event streaming platform)
	•	Apache Tomcat (Web server and servlet container)
	•	Apache Spark (Cluster-computing framework)
	•	Apache Maven (Build automation tool)

Conclusion:

The Apache License 2.0 is a permissive, business-friendly open-source license that provides significant freedom for developers and organizations to use, modify, and distribute software, whether in open-source or proprietary projects. The key requirements are to provide attribution and include the license text in your distribution, making it one of the most flexible and popular open-source licenses today.
