Apache projects use the Apache License 2.0. This is a widely used, permissive open-source license that is designed to be business-friendly and to encourage the adoption of open-source software. The Apache License 2.0 is maintained by the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) and is used by all official Apache projects as well as many non-Apache projects.

Key Features of the Apache License 2.0:

	1.	Permissive License:
	•	The Apache License 2.0 allows users of the software (individuals or organizations) to use, modify, distribute, and even incorporate the code into proprietary software.
	•	There are no copyleft requirements like the GPL, meaning you are not required to open-source your own code if you use an Apache-licensed library.
	2.	Attribution Requirement:
	•	While you can use Apache-licensed software in your project, including in proprietary software, you must include a copy of the Apache License and any applicable notices (like copyright and attribution) in your software distribution.
	•	This includes maintaining any NOTICE files that accompany the Apache project, providing credit to the original authors and contributors.
	3.	Patent Grant:
	•	The Apache License 2.0 provides an explicit patent grant, which means that contributors to the project agree to grant users of the software a royalty-free, worldwide, non-exclusive license to use any patents that may cover the contribution.
	•	This patent clause offers legal protection for users of Apache-licensed software, allowing them to use it without fear of patent litigation from contributors.
	4.	No Strong Copyleft:
	•	Unlike the GPL (GNU General Public License), which requires derivative works to be released under the same license (copyleft), the Apache License 2.0 allows you to use Apache-licensed code in proprietary or commercial software without requiring you to open-source your application.
	•	This makes the license more flexible and attractive for businesses that want to use open-source code without exposing their proprietary code.
	5.	Compatibility with Other Licenses:
	•	Apache License 2.0 is compatible with many other open-source licenses, including permissive licenses like the MIT License and BSD License.
	•	However, it is not compatible with GPL v2, meaning you cannot combine Apache 2.0-licensed code with GPL v2-licensed code in the same project without violating one of the licenses. It is, however, compatible with GPL v3.

Summary of What You Can Do with Apache License 2.0 Software:

	•	Use the software freely for any purpose, including commercial use.
	•	Modify the software to suit your needs.
	•	Distribute the software, either in its original form or with modifications.
	•	Include the software in proprietary products, as long as you adhere to the attribution and notice requirements.

Example Projects Using the Apache License 2.0:

	•	Apache Hadoop (Big Data framework)
	•	Apache Kafka (Distributed event streaming platform)
	•	Apache Tomcat (Web server and servlet container)
	•	Apache Spark (Cluster-computing framework)
	•	Apache Maven (Build automation tool)

Conclusion:

The Apache License 2.0 is a permissive, business-friendly open-source license that provides significant freedom for developers and organizations to use, modify, and distribute software, whether in open-source or proprietary projects. The key requirements are to provide attribution and include the license text in your distribution, making it one of the most flexible and popular open-source licenses today.


### Apache licence restrictions
The Apache License 2.0 is a permissive open-source license, which gives users significant freedoms, but there are a few restrictions and obligations that you must adhere to when using software licensed under it. Here’s what you cannot do or need to be careful about when using the Apache License 2.0:

1. No Removal of License Notices or Copyright Statements

	•	You cannot remove or modify any copyright notices, trademarks, or license notices from the original code.
	•	When you distribute the software, whether modified or unmodified, you must retain all existing notices, such as the LICENSE file and any NOTICE files that accompany the project.
	•	If you modify the software, you are required to add your own copyright notice to the files you modify.

2. No Use of Trademarks

	•	The Apache License does not grant permission to use the trademarks or branding (e.g., logos, product names) of the project or the Apache Software Foundation (ASF).
	•	For example, if you’re using Apache Hadoop or Apache Kafka, you can’t use the names “Hadoop” or “Kafka” in your own product name or imply endorsement by the Apache Software Foundation without explicit permission.

3. Patent Retaliation Clause

	•	The Apache License 2.0 includes a patent retaliation clause. This means that if you file a patent lawsuit against any contributor of the software for patent infringement related to the software, you automatically lose the rights to use the software granted under the Apache License.
	•	This is meant to protect contributors from patent litigation while still allowing them to contribute freely to the open-source project.

4. Provide Attribution (Inclusion of License and Notice Files)

	•	You must provide proper attribution when distributing the software, whether you’ve modified it or not. This includes:
	•	Including the full text of the Apache License 2.0 in any distribution of the software (usually via a LICENSE file).
	•	Including any required notices found in the project’s NOTICE file, especially if you redistribute or modify the project. If you make modifications, you need to add your own attributions as well, but still retain any existing ones.
	•	If you’re distributing modified versions of the software, you must document the modifications and maintain the attributions from the original work.

5. Do Not Misrepresent the Origin of the Software

	•	You cannot falsely claim that you are the original author of the software or mislead others into thinking the original creators endorse your modified version. You must retain credit for the original authors and maintain the NOTICE file if it exists.

6. No Warranty or Liability

	•	The Apache License 2.0 comes with an explicit disclaimer of warranties and liability. If you use the software, you do so at your own risk. This is not really a restriction but something important to keep in mind:
	•	The software is provided “as-is,” meaning that the original authors of the software cannot be held responsible for any damages, defects, or other issues arising from the use of the software.

What You Cannot Do:

	1.	Use Trademarks Without Permission:
	•	You cannot use the name, logos, or trademarks of Apache projects without following the ASF’s trademark policy or obtaining explicit permission from the trademark owner.
	2.	Hide the License or Copyright Information:
	•	You cannot distribute the software without including the original Apache License text and any relevant NOTICE files that were included with the original project. Modifying the license or failing to include it is a violation.
	3.	File Patent Lawsuits Without Consequences:
	•	You cannot file a patent lawsuit against the authors of the software without losing your rights to use the software. The license includes a patent retaliation clause to protect contributors.
	4.	Change the License of the Software Itself:
	•	You cannot re-license the software under a different license. Any redistribution must retain the Apache License 2.0 unless the project has added additional licenses (dual-licensing). You can, however, combine Apache-licensed code with other code under different licenses as long as they are compatible (e.g., permissive licenses like MIT or BSD).

What You Can Do (Freedoms):

	•	Modify and distribute the software, either in its original form or with modifications.
	•	Use the software in proprietary and commercial applications without releasing your source code (no copyleft).
	•	Combine the software with other open-source or proprietary code.
	•	Sell the software as part of a commercial product as long as you comply with the attribution requirements.

Conclusion:

The Apache License 2.0 is permissive and allows a great deal of freedom, including use in proprietary projects. However, you must ensure that you:

	•	Include the license and proper attribution (via LICENSE and NOTICE files).
	•	Respect the trademarks and don’t use them without permission.
	•	Follow the patent retaliation clause, avoiding patent lawsuits against contributors if you wish to keep using the software.

By adhering to these simple restrictions, you can use Apache-licensed software freely in most contexts, including commercial and proprietary applications.
