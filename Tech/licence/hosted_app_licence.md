When considering the effect of licenses like GPL (GNU General Public License) and the Apache License 2.0 on online hosted applications, the key difference revolves around the distribution of software. Here’s how these licenses affect online applications:

1. GPL (GNU General Public License)

A. GPL v2 and v3 for Hosted Applications

	•	GPL v2 and GPL v3 generally apply to the distribution of software. If you distribute the software (e.g., provide a downloadable copy), you must provide the source code of the entire program under the GPL license. However, using GPL-licensed software to run an online application (e.g., a web service) does not trigger distribution, and therefore does not require you to release the source code.
	•	GPL v2 and GPL v3 were originally designed with traditional software distribution in mind, not online services or Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). As a result, if you are using GPL-licensed software to run a web application, you do not have to provide the source code unless you distribute the software itself (e.g., by providing a download for the software).

B. AGPL (Affero GPL) – A Variation for Network Use

	•	To address the loophole where companies could use GPL software for web services without sharing source code, the AGPL (Affero General Public License) was introduced. Under AGPL v3, if you make a modified version of the software available to users over a network (such as a web app or SaaS), you are required to release the source code to those users, even if the software is not distributed in the traditional sense.
	•	Effect of AGPL on Hosted Applications: If you modify an AGPL-licensed library and use it in a hosted web application, you must provide the modified source code to the users who interact with your application over the network.
	•	Example: If you’re using an AGPL-licensed database (like MongoDB under AGPL v3) for a web application, you are required to make the source code available to users accessing your service.

Key Difference Between GPL and AGPL for Hosted Applications:

	•	GPL (v2/v3): Running a hosted service using GPL software does not trigger the copyleft requirement, so you don’t have to release your source code.
	•	AGPL: If you modify AGPL software and run it in a hosted service, you must provide the source code to users accessing the service.

2. Apache License 2.0

A. No Distribution Requirement for Online Services

	•	The Apache License 2.0 is permissive and does not have any copyleft obligations. It focuses on providing freedom to use, modify, and distribute the software, while requiring attribution and license inclusion if the software is redistributed.
	•	For online hosted applications, the Apache License 2.0 does not impose any obligations to release the source code, even if the software is being used to run a web service or SaaS application. There is no concept of a “network-based distribution” like in the AGPL.

B. Use in Proprietary and Hosted Applications

	•	The Apache License 2.0 allows you to use the licensed software in any application, including proprietary, closed-source, or commercial web services or SaaS applications.
	•	You are free to use Apache-licensed code in a hosted application without providing the source code to users, as long as you include the necessary license and attribution notices in any distribution (if applicable).

Summary of Effects for Hosted Applications:

License	Distribution Requirement	Effect on Hosted Applications (SaaS)
GPL v2/v3	Source code must be provided if you distribute the software.	No obligation to release the source code unless the software itself is distributed.
AGPL v3	Source code must be provided if the software is used over a network.	You must release the source code to users accessing the service over the network.
Apache License 2.0	No copyleft. Source code is not required to be released.	You are free to use the software in hosted services without making the source code available.

Key Takeaways:

	1.	GPL v2 and v3: Running a GPL-licensed application as an online service does not trigger the copyleft requirement unless you distribute the software itself. You can use GPL libraries in your web service without releasing your source code.
	2.	AGPL v3: If you’re using an AGPL-licensed library in an online service and users interact with the service over a network, you are required to release the source code to those users.
	3.	Apache License 2.0: The Apache License 2.0 has no copyleft requirements, and using Apache-licensed software in hosted services or SaaS does not require you to release the source code.

For companies running online services, the key concern is whether they are using AGPL-licensed software, as it imposes obligations to release source code for services provided over a network. GPL and Apache License 2.0 generally allow the use of software in hosted services without imposing any requirement to release the source code.
