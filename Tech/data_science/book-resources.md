The core idea at the heart of model-based machine learning is that all the assumptions about the problem domain are made explicit in the form of a model. This model is then used to create a model-specific algorithm to solve the specific machine learning problem. Model-based machine learning can be applied to pretty much any problem, and its general-purpose approach means you donâ€™t need to learn a huge number of machine learning algorithms and techniques.
