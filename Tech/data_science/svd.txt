# SVD and LSI

Information Retrieval. SVD became very useful in Information Retrieval (IR) to deal with
linguistic ambiguity issues. IR works by producing the documents most associated with a set of
keywords in a query. Keywords, however, necessarily contain much synonymy (several keywords
refer to the same concept) and polysemy (the same keyword can refer to several concepts). For
instance, if the query keyword is "feline", traditional IR methods will not retrieve documents
using the word "cat" – a problem of synonymy. Likewise, if the query keyword is "java",
documents on the topic of Java as a computer language, Java as an Island in Indonesia, and Java
as a coffee bean will all be retrieved – a problem of polysemy. A technique known Latent
Semantic Indexing (LSI) (Berry et al., 1995) addresses these problems by calculating the best
rank-l approximation of the keyword-document matrix using its SVD. This produces a lower
dimensional space of singular vectors that are called eigen-keywords and eigen-documents. Each
eigen-keyword can be associated with several keywords as well as particular senses of keywords.
In the synonymy example above, "cat" and "feline" would therefore be strongly correlated with
the same eigen-keyterm. Similarly, documents using "Java" as a computer language tend to use
many of the same keywords, but not many of the keywords used by documents describing "Java"
as coffee or Indonesia. Thus, in the space of singular vectors, each of these senses of "java" is
associated with distinct eigen-keywords.
