Check out the intuitive python etc implementation of algorithms.
The most interesting is not the output or how it works.
Its the, why it works and when it will not work. 
Dig into the details of these, to understand the nitty gritty of it.
In the real physical world there are rare opportunities where you can just apply the algorithm as it is. Most are already solved problem.
The unsolved ones are there because it requires a variation of these algorithms or more creative thinking.
Have to look into the details of implementation to understand the nitty gritty of each of these.

Basic requisite 
- is to have linear algebra/maths concepts very clear
- know how to read papers. Follow the notations and derive the answers
- hands on the basic concepts around statistics and probability theory
