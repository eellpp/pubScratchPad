## OOD - Class Design

http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod

The first five principles are principles of class design. They are:

1) SRP	The Single Responsibility Principle	A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.
2) OCP	The Open Closed Principle	You should be able to extend a classes behavior, without modifying it.
3) LSP	The Liskov Substitution Principle	Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.
4) ISP	The Interface Segregation Principle	Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific.
5) DIP	The Dependency Inversion Principle	Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
