The main value in software is not the code produced, but the knowledge accumulated by the people who produced it.

### Restaurant Metaphor:

If you run a commercial kitchen and you only ever cook food, because selling cooked food is your business -- if you never clean the dishes, never scrape the grill, never organize the freezer -- the health inspector will shut your shit down pretty quickly.

Software, on the other hand, doesn't have health inspectors. It has kitchen staff who become more alarmed over time at the state of the kitchen they're working in every day, and if nothing is done about it, there will come a point where the kitchen starts failing to produce edible meals.

Generally, you can either convince decision makers that cleaning the kitchen is more profitable in the long run or you can dust off your resume and get out before it burns down.


### Library Metaphor
Say you want to start a lending library, you hire one person and stock 25 books. The stock is small and one person can easily remember all of them so the employee just piles them up in a corner. If a customer wants fiction or literature or whatever, the employee could easily look up the pile and pull it out.

Over time the books grows from 25 to 50, the stocks still small and there's just one employee so they are all just added to the pile.

50 grows to 150, you hire one more. The old guy feels that since there are two of them one can lookup the first 75 while the other can search the next 75 and organizing would a waste of time and space.

When you hit 500 books the debt starts to kick in but again you try to solve it by hiring more people. Some of the new hires want to categorize the books into proper racks but that would mean shutting shop for few days and not adding any new books. This is unacceptable to a non technical manager so things continue to be the old way.

By the time you hit 1000 books some of the employees are fed up with the time consuming work and quit, the replacements have no clue what is where. Most of the customers were served purely based on the muscle memory of the old employees and now that they have gone the business starts to crumble.

### The Capability Trap
The core idea is that you have pressure to deliver a product (get "real" work done), but also maintain or improve your ability to do the work. If you ignore that maintenance portion, you end up being able to produce less over time. And the cost to recover the capability increases over time due to neglect.

In the kitchen example, cleaning and maintaining the fryers every (period of time) means that you can get years, if not decades, out of them. But failing to do so may force you to turn them off (produce less food for customers at a time). Then you have to either replace or pay for expensive maintenance and repair work, which is usually more costly than just having someone come in and drain the system, clean it, and give it a once over every (period of time).
