### **SSH (Secure Shell)** vs **SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)**:

| **Aspect**             | **SSH**                                                                                 | **SSL/TLS**                                                                           |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**            | Secure remote access to systems and command-line interfaces.                              | Secure communication between client-server applications (e.g., HTTPS for web traffic).  |
| **Encryption**         | Provides end-to-end encryption for terminal sessions and file transfers (SCP/SFTP).       | Provides encryption for data transfer over networks (HTTPS, SMTPS, etc.).               |
| **Authentication**     | Uses password-based or public key-based authentication.                                   | Uses digital certificates (X.509) for server and optionally client authentication.      |
| **Protocols**          | Primarily TCP-based, typically operates on port 22.                                       | Primarily operates over TCP (ports 443, 465) using TLS for web, email, and VPNs.        |
| **Use Cases**          | Remote shell access, secure file transfers, tunneling.                                    | Web security (HTTPS), secure email, VPN connections, and any client-server interaction. |

In summary, **SSH** secures remote system access, while **SSL/TLS** secures communication between clients and servers, mostly used for websites and other network services.
