### Avoid using Manager in name
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1866794/naming-classes-how-to-avoid-calling-everything-a-whatevermanager  


And a current list of name prefixes/suffixes I collected (subjectively!) from the answers:

- Coordinator
- Builder
- Writer
- Reader
- Handler
- Container
- Protocol
- Target
- Converter
- Controller
- View
- Factory
- Entity
- Bucket

And a good tip for the road:  
>> Don't get naming paralysis. Yes, names are very important but they're not important enough to waste huge amounts of time on. If you can't think up a good name in 10 minutes, move on.
