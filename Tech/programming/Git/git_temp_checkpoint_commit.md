Yes, you can use **interactive rebase** to rewrite your commit history, combining or editing your local quick commit messages into a single meaningful one before merging to the `master` branch and pushing to the remote repository.

Hereâ€™s how you can achieve this:

### Workflow

1. **Commit with Quick Messages Locally**:
   You can make quick commits with temporary messages in your local branch while working on your feature.
   
   Example:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "quick fix 1"
   git commit -m "quick fix 2"
   git commit -m "quick fix 3"
   ```

2. **Interactive Rebase to Edit Commit Messages**:
   Once you are done with your changes and are ready to merge your branch into `master`, you can use an interactive rebase to edit or combine your quick commit messages into a single, more meaningful commit.

   To rebase interactively:
   ```bash
   git rebase -i <base-commit>
   ```
   Where `<base-commit>` is the commit hash before your first "quick fix" commit (you can also use `HEAD~<number of commits>` if you know how many commits back).

   This will open an interactive editor showing your recent commits. Example:
   ```
   pick abc123 quick fix 1
   pick def456 quick fix 2
   pick ghi789 quick fix 3
   ```

  if you don't know the base-commit 
  1. Use >> `git log -n 10` to see last 10 commits . And then pick the base commit 
  2. Use >> `git merge-base <current-branch> master` . This will show the commit from which branch diverged. 

3. **Squash or Edit Commits**:
   - To **combine (squash)** all the quick commits into one, change the command from `pick` to `squash` (or simply `s`) on the lines with the commits you want to combine.
   - The first commit should remain as `pick`, and the subsequent commits will be squashed into it.

   Example:
   ```
   pick abc123 quick fix 1
   squash def456 quick fix 2
   squash ghi789 quick fix 3
   ```

   After this, Git will open another editor for you to write a single, comprehensive commit message for all the changes combined.

4. **Merge to Master**:
   After the rebase, your commit history will now have a single clean commit with a meaningful message. You can now merge it into `master` without exposing your quick commit messages.
   
   Example:
   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git merge <your-branch>
   ```

5. **Push to Remote**:
   Finally, when you push the `master` branch, only the clean commit will be sent to the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin master
   ```

### Key Benefits:
- **Local Freedom**: You can make as many small, quick commits as you like during development, which is useful for checkpointing or experimenting.
- **Clean History**: When you merge to `master`, the final history will be clean, with meaningful commit messages, without exposing all your small commits.
