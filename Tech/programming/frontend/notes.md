Quick prototype:

### UI + SaaS backends 

React + firebase

The best tech stack is the one that gets the job done FOR YOU, in the least amount of time. If it takes me 4 weeks to learn some arbitrary <INSERT NOUN HERE>.js framework to then be able to do stuff "quickly" then it better cut down development time by atleast +4 weeks to be worth it. 

Only general piece of advice is to use SaaS tools to do heavy lifting. Tools like Auth0, Firebase Cloud Functions and authorization, etc can save you quite a bit of time compared to the learning curve they come with. Not to mention these products have teams behind them who work round the clock to make them developer friendly, so if you can't understand and get them running quick enough then IMO the tool is flawed not the user.
