Directives are markers on a DOM element (such as an attribute, element name, comment or CSS class)  

### Class Directives
class:selected="{current === 'foo'}"   

The selected class is added to the element whenever the value of the expression is truthy, and removed when it's falsy.

<div class:big={big}>
