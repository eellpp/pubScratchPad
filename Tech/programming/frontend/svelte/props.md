 ### A variable that can be passed into a child within the child component itself
 
 ```bash
//APP.svelte
<script>
	import Nested from './Nested.svelte';
</script>

<Nested answer={42}/>

// Nested.svelte
<script>
	export let answer;
</script>

<p>The answer is {answer}</p>

 ```
export let answer;  
to indicate that Button takes text as a prop.  
Then in App.svelte , we write:  
<Button text='Toggle' />  
to pass in the string 'Toggle' to Button . Since Button references text between the button tags, we see the word Toggle as the text for the button.  


#### Spread Props
We can use the spread operator to spread an objectâ€™s properties into multiple props.  
For instance, if we want to pass in more than one prop, we can write the following:  
```bash
App.svelte ;
<script>
  import Info from "./Info.svelte";
  const person = {
    name: "Jane Smith",
    age: 20,
    gender: "female"
  };
</script>

<main>
  <Info {...person} />
</main>

Info.svelte :
<script>
  export let name;
  export let age;
  export let gender;
</script>
<p>{name} {age} {gender}</p>
```
