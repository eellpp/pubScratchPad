### Difference between __init__.py and __main__.py
__init__.py is run when you import a package into a running python program. For instance, import idlelib within a program, runs idlelib/__init__.py, which does not do anything as its only purpose is to mark the idlelib directory as a package. On the otherhand, tkinter/__init__.py contains most of the tkinter code and defines all the widget classes.  

__main__.py is run as '__main__' when you run a package as the main program. For instance, python -m idlelib at a command line runs idlelib/__main__.py, which starts Idle.
