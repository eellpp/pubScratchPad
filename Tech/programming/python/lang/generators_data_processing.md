Generators are one of the concepts that devs from other languages under use in Python. It's a natural solution to a ton of problems, since it lazily evaluates, and only stores one result out of the entire sequence at a time, and its interface is compatible with the iterator protocol. It's a mini state machine with it's own little memory world as well.
