Java has several "gotchas" that can catch even seasoned developers by surprise if they aren’t aware of them. 

1. **Autoboxing and Unboxing Pitfalls**: When Java automatically converts between primitive types (like `int`) and their wrapper classes (`Integer`), known as autoboxing/unboxing, subtle issues can arise. For instance, comparing `Integer` objects with `==` can lead to unexpected behavior due to caching and reference comparisons instead of value comparisons. The `==` operator compares references for objects, so two `Integer` objects with the same value might not be `==` unless they're within the cached range (-128 to 127)【28†source】【30†source】.

2. **Floating-Point Arithmetic**: Floating-point operations are inherently imprecise due to their binary representation, which can lead to unexpected results in arithmetic operations. Even seemingly simple calculations, like `0.1 + 0.2`, might yield a result that isn't exactly `0.3` due to rounding errors. It’s often better to use `BigDecimal` for financial calculations to avoid such issues【31†source】.

3. **Mutability of `String` and `StringBuilder` Behavior**: Java `String` objects are immutable, meaning any modification results in a new `String` object being created. This can be a performance issue in loops or repeated concatenations. Using `StringBuilder` or `StringBuffer` (for thread-safe needs) is preferable in such cases. Additionally, the `intern()` method on `String` can lead to memory leaks if not used carefully, as it places strings in a pool that is difficult to reclaim until the Java process ends【29†source】.

4. **Default Serialization Traps**: Java’s default serialization can be inefficient and can cause maintenance issues. It’s recommended to implement `Serializable` carefully, as serialization exposes private data and can lead to issues with backward compatibility if class structures change. Overriding `readObject` and `writeObject` methods is often needed to manage serialization effectively and securely【28†source】.

5. **Overuse of `Finalize()` and Garbage Collection Timing**: The `finalize()` method is not guaranteed to run in a timely manner, and it may not run at all if the object is never garbage-collected. Since Java 9, `finalize()` has been deprecated due to its unreliability. Instead, the `try-with-resources` statement is preferred for releasing resources like file streams or database connections【30†source】.

6. **Type Erasure with Generics**: Java generics use type erasure, which removes generic type information at runtime. This means that certain type checks (like checking if an object is an instance of a parameterized type) are not possible. For example, you can’t directly check if an `Object` is an instance of a generic type like `List<Integer>`. Additionally, this can cause issues with method overloading, as methods that differ only in generic parameters will cause a compile-time error【29†source】【31†source】.

7. **Concurrency and `HashMap`**: `HashMap` is not thread-safe, and using it in a concurrent setting can lead to infinite loops or data corruption. `ConcurrentHashMap` or `Collections.synchronizedMap` are better alternatives when thread safety is required. Similarly, common practices, like double-checked locking, are error-prone without `volatile`, due to Java’s memory model【32†source】【28†source】.

8. **Java ArrayLists do not shrink automatically** :
