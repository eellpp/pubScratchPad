Writing a design document before coding a Java class is a great practice. It helps to clarify requirements, design decisions, and ensure alignment with the overall project architecture. Here are some useful templates and practices for writing an effective design document:

### Key Sections of a Java Class Design Document

1. **Title and Overview**
   - **Title**: Name of the class.
   - **Overview**: A high-level description of the class, its purpose, and where it fits into the system. It should outline what the class is supposed to do.

2. **Problem Statement**
   - Describe the problem that the class aims to solve.
   - Specify the requirements that led to the need for this class.

3. **Responsibilities**
   - Define the **Single Responsibility** of this classâ€”what the class is supposed to do and only do.
   - You can also outline any **major responsibilities** it will have, such as interacting with other classes, maintaining data, or performing specific calculations.

4. **Public API (Methods and Fields)**
   - List and describe the **public methods** and fields that will be available in the class.
   - Define method signatures: **name, parameters, return types**, and **exceptions** that might be thrown.
   - Add JavaDoc-style comments if necessary.

   Example:
   ```java
   /**
    * Retrieves the user profile data.
    * @param userId The ID of the user.
    * @return UserProfile instance containing the user's details.
    * @throws UserNotFoundException if the user is not found.
    */
   public UserProfile getUserProfile(String userId) throws UserNotFoundException;
   ```

5. **Class Relationships**
   - **Dependencies**: List other classes or external libraries that this class will depend on.
   - **Collaboration**: Mention other classes that this class will interact with.
   - **Design Patterns**: Mention any design patterns (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Observer) used in the design and why they were chosen.

6. **Data and State**
   - Outline **fields/attributes** of the class.
   - Explain any **data structure** used and how data is represented.
   - **Encapsulation**: Describe how the data is accessed and manipulated to ensure data integrity.

7. **Sequence and Interaction Diagrams (Optional)**
   - For more complex classes, include **sequence diagrams** or **interaction diagrams** to visualize how the class methods will interact with other parts of the system.
   - Use tools like **PlantUML**, **Lucidchart**, or even simple sketches.

8. **Design Considerations**
   - Describe specific **design decisions**, trade-offs, and constraints.
   - Considerations around **performance, scalability, reusability**, and **extensibility**.
   - Mention any relevant **thread safety** concerns or **synchronization** requirements.

9. **Edge Cases and Error Handling**
   - Describe how the class will handle **edge cases**.
   - Discuss **exceptions** or error states and how they will be managed.

10. **Testing Plan**
    - Describe how the class will be tested.
    - Mention **unit tests**, including the methods and specific scenarios that will be covered.

11. **Future Extensions and Maintenance**
    - Briefly mention any potential **future requirements** that this class may need to support.
    - Describe how easy or difficult it would be to extend or modify the class.

12. **References**
    - Reference any documents or diagrams that relate to this class, like other design docs, system architecture, or APIs used.

### Example Design Document Outline

```
# Class Design Document: UserProfileManager

## 1. Overview
- **Name**: UserProfileManager
- **Purpose**: Manage user profile information including retrieval, updates, and validation.

## 2. Problem Statement
- The system needs a centralized component to handle user profile management and enforce data integrity.

## 3. Responsibilities
- Retrieve user profile data.
- Update and validate user profiles.
- Handle different data persistence mechanisms.

## 4. Public API
- **getUserProfile(userId: String): UserProfile**
  - Retrieves user profile by user ID.
- **updateUserProfile(profile: UserProfile): boolean**
  - Updates profile information and returns status.

## 5. Class Relationships
- **Dependencies**:
  - Depends on `UserRepository` for persistence.
- **Collaborations**:
  - Collaborates with `NotificationService` to send profile update notifications.

## 6. Data and State
- **Fields**:
  - `Map<String, UserProfile> userProfilesCache` for caching profiles.
  
## 7. Sequence Diagram (Optional)
- [Link to Sequence Diagram]

## 8. Design Considerations
- **Thread Safety**: The cache is read-write, and thread safety must be ensured with `ConcurrentHashMap`.
- **Scalability**: Cache might need to be distributed in the future.

## 9. Edge Cases and Error Handling
- Handle non-existent user profiles gracefully.
- Handle concurrent updates and race conditions.

## 10. Testing Plan
- **Unit Tests**:
  - `testGetUserProfile_existingUser()`
  - `testUpdateUserProfile_invalidData()`

## 11. Future Extensions
- Consider adding integration with a new analytics module for user profile insights.

## 12. References
- System Architecture Document v1.3

### Best Practices for Writing a Design Doc
1. **Be Concise, but Thorough**: Keep it simple but ensure all the necessary details are there.
2. **Collaborate Early**: Share your design document with your team early to get feedback before coding starts.
3. **Use Visual Aids**: Diagrams can be very helpful for explaining complex flows or relationships.
4. **Document Decisions**: Clearly document design choices, including any alternatives considered and why they were rejected.
5. **Focus on Readability**: The goal is for someone unfamiliar with the code to understand the design intent, so avoid over-complicating the document.

A well-written design doc can save you time later by clarifying your approach upfront and helping you make better-informed decisions during implementation.
