The key difference between `CompletableFuture` and `Future` lies in their features and capabilities for handling asynchronous computations in Java. Let's explore these differences and understand when to use each.

### **1. Future** (`java.util.concurrent.Future`)

The `Future` interface was introduced in Java 5 and is part of the `java.util.concurrent` package. It represents the result of an asynchronous computation, and it provides methods to check if the computation is complete, to wait for its completion, and to retrieve the result.

#### Features of `Future`:
- **Basic Asynchronous Computation**: `Future` represents the result of a computation that may not have completed yet.
- **Blocking Operations**: You can call `future.get()` to wait for the result of the computation, but this call blocks the current thread until the computation is complete.
- **No Manual Completion**: Once a `Future` is created, it cannot be manually completed. The result must come from the computation.
- **No Chaining or Combining**: `Future` lacks methods to chain multiple asynchronous computations or to combine results of multiple futures.
- **Cancellation**: You can cancel a task using `future.cancel()`.

#### Example of `Future`:
```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
Future<Integer> future = executor.submit(() -> {
    // Simulate a long-running task
    Thread.sleep(1000);
    return 42;
});

// Block and wait for the result
Integer result = future.get();
System.out.println(result);
executor.shutdown();
```

### **2. CompletableFuture** (`java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture`)

`CompletableFuture` was introduced in Java 8 and extends the `Future` interface. It represents a more powerful and flexible way of handling asynchronous computations.

#### Features of `CompletableFuture`:
- **Non-blocking Operations**: `CompletableFuture` provides non-blocking methods to check for completion (like `thenApply`, `thenAccept`, etc.) and allows you to set up actions to be triggered upon completion.
- **Manual Completion**: `CompletableFuture` allows manual completion of the future using methods like `complete()`, `completeExceptionally()`.
- **Chaining and Combining**: You can chain multiple asynchronous computations using methods like `thenApply()`, `thenCompose()`, `thenAccept()`, etc. You can also combine multiple `CompletableFuture` instances with methods like `allOf()`, `anyOf()`.
- **Functional Programming Style**: Supports lambda expressions and method references for defining asynchronous task pipelines.
- **Exception Handling**: Built-in support for handling exceptions using methods like `exceptionally()` or `handle()`.
- **Multiple Threads**: You can easily perform asynchronous operations across different threads with `supplyAsync()` or `runAsync()`.

#### Example of `CompletableFuture`:
```java
CompletableFuture<Integer> completableFuture = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
    // Simulate a long-running task
    sleep(1000);
    return 42;
});

// Non-blocking chaining and completion handling
completableFuture.thenApply(result -> result * 2)
                 .thenAccept(result -> System.out.println("Result: " + result));

// Optional blocking wait
completableFuture.get();
```

### **Key Differences:**

| Feature               | `Future`                            | `CompletableFuture`               |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Non-blocking**       | No, `get()` is blocking             | Yes, supports non-blocking methods|
| **Completion Handling**| Basic (`isDone()`, `get()`)         | Rich APIs for chaining, combining |
| **Manual Completion**  | No                                  | Yes (`complete()`, `completeExceptionally()`) |
| **Chaining**           | No                                  | Yes (`thenApply()`, `thenCompose()`) |
| **Combining Futures**  | No                                  | Yes (`allOf()`, `anyOf()`)        |
| **Exception Handling** | Limited (manual try-catch)          | Built-in exception handling (`exceptionally()`, `handle()`) |
| **Functional Style**   | No                                  | Yes, supports lambdas and method references |

### **When to Use `Future`**:
- **Simple Use Cases**: When you need a basic asynchronous task and don't require chaining, combining, or manual completion.
- **Legacy Code**: In systems that predate Java 8 or when working with APIs that only return `Future`.
- **Blocking Tasks**: When itâ€™s acceptable to block the current thread while waiting for a result.

### **When to Use `CompletableFuture`**:
- **Complex Asynchronous Flows**: When you need to chain multiple asynchronous tasks together, perform actions when tasks complete, or combine multiple asynchronous computations.
- **Non-blocking Behavior**: When you want to avoid blocking threads and handle asynchronous results in a non-blocking way.
- **Manual Completion**: When you need the ability to complete or fail a task manually.
- **Functional Programming**: When you prefer a more functional, declarative style of programming with lambdas and method references.
- **Error Handling**: When you need built-in exception handling for asynchronous computations.

In modern Java applications, `CompletableFuture` is typically preferred over `Future` because of its richer feature set, non-blocking capabilities, and ability to chain tasks together.
