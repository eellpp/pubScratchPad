Having multiple stages in a JavaFX application can be useful in various scenarios where you need more than one window to manage different parts of the application or display separate content to the user. Here are some common use cases for using multiple stages in a JavaFX app:

1. Dialog Windows (Custom Alerts or Prompts)

A common use case for multiple stages is displaying dialog windows (like custom alerts, prompts, or confirmation dialogs). For example, when a user performs an action that requires additional input or confirmation, a secondary window (new stage) can pop up.

Example Use Case:

	•	When the user clicks a “Delete” button, a confirmation window (a new stage) appears asking, “Are you sure you want to delete this item?” This secondary window is independent of the main application window but ensures that the user’s action is confirmed.
```java
Stage dialogStage = new Stage();
dialogStage.initModality(Modality.APPLICATION_MODAL); // Block interaction with other windows
dialogStage.setTitle("Confirmation");
VBox vbox = new VBox(new Text("Are you sure you want to delete?"), new Button("OK"));
Scene dialogScene = new Scene(vbox, 200, 100);
dialogStage.setScene(dialogScene);
dialogStage.showAndWait(); // Wait for the user to close the window
```
2. Settings or Preferences Window

Applications often include a settings or preferences window, which could be opened separately from the main application window. This allows users to configure application settings, such as appearance, theme, language, or other preferences, without affecting the main stage.

Example Use Case:

	•	The user clicks “Preferences” in the main application window, and a new window (stage) opens with various configuration options. The preferences window can be closed independently while the main application continues running.
```java
Stage settingsStage = new Stage();
settingsStage.setTitle("Application Settings");
VBox settingsLayout = new VBox();
Scene settingsScene = new Scene(settingsLayout, 300, 200);
settingsStage.setScene(settingsScene);
settingsStage.show();
```

3. Pop-up Tools or Utility Windows

For applications that require utility windows, such as tool palettes, debugging tools, or extra information panels, multiple stages can be useful. These windows are usually non-modal and remain accessible alongside the main window, giving users the ability to toggle between windows as needed.

Example Use Case:

	•	A photo editing app might have a tool palette in one window (stage) and the main canvas in another window. The tool palette allows the user to select different editing tools, which are then applied in the main window.

```java
Stage toolPaletteStage = new Stage();
toolPaletteStage.setTitle("Tool Palette");
VBox toolBox = new VBox();
toolBox.getChildren().addAll(new Button("Brush"), new Button("Eraser"));
Scene toolScene = new Scene(toolBox, 100, 300);
toolPaletteStage.setScene(toolScene);
toolPaletteStage.show();
```

4. Login or Authentication Window

In applications where login or authentication is required, a separate stage can be used to handle the login process. The main window is only displayed after successful authentication, keeping the login process separate from the rest of the application.

Example Use Case:

	•	When a user opens the app, a login window (stage) appears, and only after entering the correct credentials does the main application window become accessible.

```java
Stage loginStage = new Stage();
loginStage.setTitle("Login");
VBox loginBox = new VBox(new TextField("Username"), new PasswordField(), new Button("Login"));
Scene loginScene = new Scene(loginBox, 200, 150);
loginStage.setScene(loginScene);
loginStage.show();
```

5. Multi-Window Applications (e.g., Document-Based UI)

For applications that manage multiple documents, such as a word processor or text editor, each document can open in its own stage. This gives users the flexibility to work on multiple documents simultaneously in separate windows, similar to how many desktop applications function (e.g., Microsoft Word or Adobe Photoshop).

Example Use Case:

	•	A text editor application allows the user to open multiple files, each in its own window (stage), enabling the user to work on multiple files simultaneously.

```java
Stage documentStage = new Stage();
documentStage.setTitle("Document 1");
TextArea textArea = new TextArea();
Scene documentScene = new Scene(new VBox(textArea), 500, 400);
documentStage.setScene(documentScene);
documentStage.show();
```
6. Splash Screen

A splash screen is a window that shows initial loading information or branding while the main application is initializing in the background. This is often implemented using a separate stage that closes once the main application is ready to load.

Example Use Case:

	•	Upon starting the application, a splash screen appears with a logo and a loading indicator. Once the application has finished loading its resources, the splash screen closes, and the main window (stage) opens.

```java
Stage splashStage = new Stage();
splashStage.setTitle("Loading...");
VBox splashLayout = new VBox(new Text("Loading..."));
Scene splashScene = new Scene(splashLayout, 300, 200);
splashStage.setScene(splashScene);
splashStage.show();
```

// Simulate loading for 3 seconds
new Timeline(new KeyFrame(Duration.seconds(3), e -> splashStage.close())).play();

7. Help or Documentation Window

In many applications, a separate window is used to display help documentation, tutorials, or other reference material. This window can be opened as needed by the user and closed without affecting the main application.

Example Use Case:

	•	When the user clicks “Help” from the menu, a new window opens displaying help documentation or a user guide. The main application window remains accessible while the user reads the documentation.

```java
Stage helpStage = new Stage();
helpStage.setTitle("Help");
VBox helpLayout = new VBox(new Text("Help content goes here..."));
Scene helpScene = new Scene(helpLayout, 400, 300);
helpStage.setScene(helpScene);
helpStage.show();
```

8. Error or Logging Window

Applications with complex workflows often require a logging or error window to display debug information or runtime errors. This window can be a separate stage that shows detailed logs or system status, which can be useful for development or troubleshooting.

Example Use Case:

	•	An application displays a separate error window (stage) that shows real-time log information, which is updated dynamically as the application runs. The user can inspect the logs without interrupting the main application flow.

```java
Stage logStage = new Stage();
logStage.setTitle("Logs");
TextArea logArea = new TextArea();
logArea.setEditable(false);
Scene logScene = new Scene(new VBox(logArea), 600, 400);
logStage.setScene(logScene);
logStage.show();
```
Summary of Common Use Cases for Multiple Stages:

	1.	Custom dialog windows (confirmation prompts, alerts).
	2.	Settings or preferences windows for configuring the application.
	3.	Tool palettes or utility windows for extra tools and features.
	4.	Login or authentication windows that precede the main application.
	5.	Document-based applications with separate windows for each document.
	6.	Splash screens that display during application loading.
	7.	Help or documentation windows to guide the user.
	8.	Error or logging windows for displaying real-time logs and errors.

These use cases enhance the user experience by providing flexible, independent windows for different tasks, allowing users to interact with multiple aspects of the application in a more organized and modular way.
