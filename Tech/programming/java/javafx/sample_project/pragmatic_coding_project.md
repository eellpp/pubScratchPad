**Application State**

The first thing you’ll notice is that we’ve added two StringProperty's fields to the class. Together these two Properties are going to act as our **State** for the application. One of them, the `name` will hold whatever the user types into the TextField and the other will hold the `greeting` that will display in the output Label.

Putting these two Properties into the class allows **all of the other coupling to be removed** .
