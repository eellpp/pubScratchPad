It's a simple DynamoDB graphical client written on JavaFX.

This client allows easy viewing, editing, creating, and deleting of data.

The main idea of the client is to reach the required data in a few clicks without thinking a scan or query operation is required for that.

The client only requires properly configured settings for the AWS CLI tool. Read the official AWS CLI documentation if it is not configured yet. Or configure a new remote or local profile manually using the "Create a new profile" dialog.
