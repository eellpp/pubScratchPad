**Retained Mode API** and **Immediate Mode API** are two general patterns used in graphics and UI programming to handle the rendering of visual elements. These are not specific to JavaFX but are widely applicable in many graphics libraries and frameworks, such as OpenGL, DirectX, HTML Canvas, and more.

### **1. Retained Mode API:**
In a **retained mode API**, the system or framework **retains** the state of the graphical objects, such as shapes, images, and UI components, in a structured **scene graph** or object tree. Once the graphical objects are defined, the framework takes responsibility for:
- **Rendering** the objects at appropriate times (usually during a refresh or render cycle).
- **Managing** the scene graph, updating it when changes occur (e.g., resizing, moving, or animating objects).
- **Tracking** object relationships (e.g., parent-child hierarchies, Z-ordering).

**How it works**:
- Developers define a set of graphical objects or UI components once.
- The API/framework keeps track of these objects and automatically updates and renders them as needed.
- The API handles optimizations like rendering only changed parts of the scene.

#### **Advantages of Retained Mode**:
- **Ease of Use**: The framework takes care of rendering and managing the scene graph, reducing the amount of manual drawing code.
- **Automatic Updates**: Any changes to objects (e.g., position, size) are reflected automatically without explicit redraw commands.
- **Stateful**: Since the scene graph retains the state, developers can work at a higher level of abstraction, focusing on the logical structure of the UI or scene.

#### **Examples**:
- **JavaFX Scene Graph**: JavaFX uses a retained mode API where developers define graphical objects like `Rectangle`, `Text`, or `ImageView` and add them to the scene graph. JavaFX then manages rendering.
- **HTML DOM**: The browser DOM is a retained-mode system. The browser manages and updates the visual elements based on the DOM tree.

### **2. Immediate Mode API:**
In an **immediate mode API**, the system does not retain the state of graphical objects between frames. Instead, the developer must **explicitly issue drawing commands** every time a frame is rendered. The rendering code is procedural and runs in response to events or every frame.

**How it works**:
- The application directly draws the objects to the screen every time the screen needs to be updated.
- No state is stored by the framework between renders; everything is redrawn from scratch on each frame.

#### **Advantages of Immediate Mode**:
- **Fine-grained Control**: Developers have complete control over what gets rendered at any given time. This allows for custom rendering pipelines and optimizations.
- **No Overhead of Retained State**: Since no state is retained, this method can be more lightweight in cases where full control is needed.
  
#### **Examples**:
- **OpenGL/DirectX**: Both of these graphics APIs are immediate mode. Developers issue explicit drawing commands (e.g., draw triangles, lines) every frame.
- **HTML5 Canvas**: The `Canvas` element in HTML5 works in immediate mode. Every drawing operation (e.g., `fillRect`, `drawImage`) must be called each time the canvas is updated.

### **Comparison: Retained Mode vs. Immediate Mode**

| **Feature**                   | **Retained Mode API**                                                                                                    | **Immediate Mode API**                                                                                                  |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Rendering Responsibility**   | Handled by the framework, which retains the scene graph and manages updates.                                               | Explicitly handled by the developer, who issues drawing commands every frame.                                           |
| **State Management**           | The system retains and manages the state of objects.                                                                      | No state is retained; everything is redrawn each time it's needed.                                                      |
| **Ease of Use**                | Higher-level abstraction, simpler for building UIs and complex scenes.                                                     | More control but requires more code to manage rendering and updating.                                                   |
| **Performance**                | Potentially slower for real-time, high-performance applications due to state management overhead, but well-optimized for UIs. | Can be more performant in specific use cases, but requires manual optimizations.                                        |
| **Use Case**                   | Best for UI libraries and applications with dynamic, hierarchical scene management.                                         | Best for real-time rendering applications, games, and situations where every frame needs to be manually managed.        |

### **Is This Specific to JavaFX?**

No, this distinction is not specific to JavaFX. **Retained Mode** and **Immediate Mode** are general patterns in graphics programming, and many other frameworks and libraries follow one or the other (or a combination) depending on their goals.

- **Retained Mode** is commonly used in UI frameworks such as **Swing**, **WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)**, **Android**, and **JavaFX**.
- **Immediate Mode** is commonly used in low-level graphics programming, real-time games, or where fine control over rendering is needed, such as in **OpenGL**, **DirectX**, and **HTML5 Canvas**.

### **Conclusion:**
Understanding whether a system uses **retained mode** or **immediate mode** helps in determining how much control the developer has over rendering and how the framework manages the drawing lifecycle. **Retained mode** simplifies UI development by letting the framework handle the rendering and state, while **immediate mode** offers greater flexibility and control, often at the cost of additional complexity.
