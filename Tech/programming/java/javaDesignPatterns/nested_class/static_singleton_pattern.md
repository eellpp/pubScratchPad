Yes, the example I provided is valid for Java 8 and later versions. In fact, the ability to create enums with behavior was introduced in Java 5, so this pattern has been available for quite some time.

However, it's worth noting that Java 8 introduced some features that can enhance or complement this pattern. Let's explore how we can leverage Java 8 features with our Planet enum example:

1. Default Methods in Interfaces:
   While not directly applicable to our enum example, Java 8's default methods can be useful when working with enums that implement interfaces.

2. Lambda Expressions and Functional Interfaces:
   We can use these to make our enum more flexible. Let's modify our example to demonstrate this:



```java
import java.util.function.DoubleBinaryOperator;

public class SolarSystem {
    // Static nested enum with behavior, enhanced with Java 8 features
    public static enum Planet {
        MERCURY(3.303e+23, 2.4397e6, (mass, radius) -> G * mass / (radius * radius)),
        VENUS(4.869e+24, 6.0518e6, (mass, radius) -> G * mass / (radius * radius)),
        EARTH(5.976e+24, 6.37814e6, (mass, radius) -> G * mass / (radius * radius)),
        MARS(6.421e+23, 3.3972e6, (mass, radius) -> G * mass / (radius * radius)),
        JUPITER(1.9e+27, 7.1492e7, (mass, radius) -> G * mass / (radius * radius)),
        SATURN(5.688e+26, 6.0268e7, (mass, radius) -> G * mass / (radius * radius)),
        URANUS(8.686e+25, 2.5559e7, (mass, radius) -> G * mass / (radius * radius)),
        NEPTUNE(1.024e+26, 2.4746e7, (mass, radius) -> G * mass / (radius * radius));

        private final double mass; // in kilograms
        private final double radius; // in meters
        private final DoubleBinaryOperator gravityCalculator;
        private static final double G = 6.67300E-11; // universal gravitational constant

        Planet(double mass, double radius, DoubleBinaryOperator gravityCalculator) {
            this.mass = mass;
            this.radius = radius;
            this.gravityCalculator = gravityCalculator;
        }

        public double surfaceGravity() {
            return gravityCalculator.applyAsDouble(mass, radius);
        }

        public double surfaceWeight(double otherMass) {
            return otherMass * surfaceGravity();
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double earthWeight = 75.0; // kg
        double mass = earthWeight / Planet.EARTH.surfaceGravity();

        // Using Java 8 streams to print results
        System.out.println("Your weight on different planets:");
        java.util.Arrays.stream(Planet.values())
            .forEach(p -> System.out.printf("  %s: %.2f N%n", p, p.surfaceWeight(mass)));
    }
}

```

Key Java 8 enhancements in this example:

1. **Functional Interface (DoubleBinaryOperator)**:
   We've introduced a `DoubleBinaryOperator` to represent the gravity calculation. This allows for more flexible gravity calculations if needed.

2. **Lambda Expressions**:
   We use lambda expressions to define the gravity calculation for each planet. In this case, they're all the same, but this approach allows for custom calculations per planet if needed.

3. **Stream API in main method**:
   We've used the Stream API to iterate over the planets and print the results, demonstrating a more functional approach to handling collections.

Additional Java 8 features that could be relevant:

4. **Method References**:
   If we had a separate method for calculating gravity, we could use method references instead of lambda expressions.

5. **Optional**:
   While not shown in this example, `Optional` could be useful if we were dealing with scenarios where a planet might not exist or a calculation might not be possible.

6. **New Date/Time API**:
   If our `Planet` enum needed to deal with time calculations (e.g., orbital periods), we could leverage the new Date/Time API introduced in Java 8.

This Java 8-enhanced version maintains the core concept of an enum with behavior while demonstrating how modern Java features can make the code more flexible and expressive. The use of functional interfaces and lambda expressions allows for more dynamic behavior definition, which can be particularly useful in more complex scenarios.
