The pattern used in Sparkâ€™s `createOrReplaceTempView` and the ability to query it with SQL is a combination of the **Facade Pattern** and the **Command Pattern**.

### **1. Facade Pattern:**
- **Description**: The **Facade Pattern** provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. In this case, the **SparkSession** class acts as a facade for working with both **DataFrames** and **SQL operations**. It abstracts away the complexity of dealing with different underlying components like the **Catalyst Optimizer** and the **DataFrame API** while providing a unified interface for performing various data processing tasks.
- **Usage**: `SparkSession` hides the complexities of creating separate contexts for SQL and DataFrames and allows seamless transitions between SQL queries and DataFrame transformations. You can create a DataFrame, register it as a temporary view, and then run SQL queries on it.

### **2. Command Pattern:**
- **Description**: The **Command Pattern** involves encapsulating a request as an object, allowing for parameterization and queuing of requests. In Spark, when you create a temporary view using `createOrReplaceTempView`, you are essentially setting up a command (SQL query) that can be executed later.
- **Usage**: When you register a DataFrame as a temporary view and then query it using `spark.sql()`, you're deferring the execution of a command. The view acts as a named reference to the DataFrame, and the SQL query is the "command" that will be executed on the view.

### **How the Design Pattern Works in Spark:**
- **DataFrame API** (facade) offers an easy-to-use, unified interface to interact with distributed data. You can perform transformations and actions without needing to know the underlying distributed computing details.
- **SQL API** (command) allows you to encapsulate SQL queries as commands that are executed later on the registered temporary view.

This combination of patterns makes it easier to manage complex data workflows while keeping the API intuitive and accessible for developers, even for complex query execution plans.
