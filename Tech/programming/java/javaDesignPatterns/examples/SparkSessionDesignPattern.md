In **Apache Spark**, the **`SparkSession`** class serves as the unified entry point for working with structured data in Spark. It abstracts away the complexities of creating different Spark contexts, including **SQLContext**, **HiveContext**, and **SparkContext**, making it easier for developers to interact with Spark's core functionalities.

Several **design patterns** are employed within the **`SparkSession`** class to ensure flexibility, scalability, and usability. Here are the key design patterns present in the **`SparkSession`**:

---

### **1. Singleton Pattern**
- **Description**: SparkSession typically follows the **Singleton Pattern**, ensuring that there is only one instance of `SparkSession` per application. This is critical to prevent multiple redundant contexts and resource allocation within a single Spark application.
- **Usage**: The `builder()` method of SparkSession enforces the singleton behavior by managing the creation of the session object in a controlled manner.
  
  **Code Example**:
  ```scala
  val spark = SparkSession.builder
              .appName("MyApp")
              .config("spark.some.config.option", "config-value")
              .getOrCreate()  // Creates or retrieves the existing session.
  ```

---

### **2. Builder Pattern**
- **Description**: The **Builder Pattern** is used to create instances of `SparkSession`. The `SparkSession.builder()` method allows for a flexible and readable way to configure and create the session with various options (e.g., app name, configurations).
- **Usage**: The builder pattern makes it easy to construct complex objects (like SparkSession) step by step, allowing for customization before the final object is created.

  **Code Example**:
  ```scala
  val spark = SparkSession.builder
              .master("local[*]")  // Specify master
              .appName("ExampleApp")  // Set application name
              .config("spark.sql.shuffle.partitions", "50")  // Add configuration
              .enableHiveSupport()  // Enable Hive support
              .getOrCreate()  // Create or retrieve the Spark session
  ```

---

### **3. Factory Pattern**
- **Description**: The **Factory Pattern** is used to abstract the creation of the Spark session and its underlying contexts (e.g., SparkContext, SQLContext). The `SparkSession.builder()` serves as the factory to create the session and ensures all necessary configurations are set up internally.
- **Usage**: The factory pattern allows for simplified object creation without exposing the complexities of creating and managing different contexts explicitly.

  **Example**: `SparkSession.builder()` method hides the internal complexity of creating SparkContext, SQLContext, and HiveContext.

---

### **4. Facade Pattern**
- **Description**: The **Facade Pattern** is implemented by the `SparkSession` class to provide a unified and simplified API for accessing various Spark features, such as working with data in DataFrames, executing SQL queries, interacting with Hive, and handling streaming data.
- **Usage**: Instead of requiring developers to manage multiple contexts (SQLContext, HiveContext), `SparkSession` acts as a single access point, making the API easier to use and understand.

  **Code Example**:
  ```scala
  val df = spark.read.json("path/to/json")  // Simplified access to data loading
  df.createOrReplaceTempView("myTable")  // Simplified access to SQL context
  spark.sql("SELECT * FROM myTable").show()  // SQL execution through SparkSession
  ```

---

### **5. Lazy Initialization Pattern**
- **Description**: The **Lazy Initialization Pattern** is used within the `SparkSession` to delay the instantiation of certain resources (like SparkContext) until they are actually needed. This pattern helps avoid unnecessary resource allocation when the session is not actively used right away.
- **Usage**: For example, `SparkSession` doesn’t initialize the actual SparkContext until an action is triggered.

---

### **6. Chain of Responsibility Pattern**
- **Description**: The **Chain of Responsibility Pattern** is implicitly used in the configuration of `SparkSession` through its builder. Each configuration step in the builder can pass along the responsibility for handling the next configuration step, creating a chain of method calls.
- **Usage**: Each method in the `builder()` pattern, such as `master()`, `config()`, or `appName()`, returns the same builder instance, allowing the chaining of methods.

  **Code Example**:
  ```scala
  val spark = SparkSession.builder()
              .appName("ChainedApp")
              .config("spark.executor.memory", "4g")
              .config("spark.sql.warehouse.dir", "warehouse_dir")
              .getOrCreate()
  ```

---

### **7. Adapter Pattern**
- **Description**: The **Adapter Pattern** can be observed in how `SparkSession` integrates with different underlying components like **Hive**, **DataFrameReader**, and **DataFrameWriter**. `SparkSession` adapts these components into a unified interface for the user, simplifying the interaction with different data sources and formats.
- **Usage**: The same `SparkSession` object adapts to interact with Hive (if Hive support is enabled) or handles different file formats (like JSON, Parquet, etc.) using the `read` and `write` APIs.

  **Code Example**:
  ```scala
  val hiveDF = spark.sql("SELECT * FROM hive_table")
  val jsonDF = spark.read.json("path/to/json/file")
  ```

---

### **8. Proxy Pattern**
- **Description**: The **Proxy Pattern** can be seen in how `SparkSession` interacts with Spark’s lower-level components (like SparkContext). `SparkSession` acts as a proxy for these components, providing controlled access while hiding the internal complexities.
- **Usage**: Users interact with `SparkSession`, and it internally manages the `SparkContext` and other components, ensuring that actions are carried out without exposing the underlying details.

---

### **Conclusion:**
`SparkSession` in Apache Spark is designed using multiple patterns, including the **Singleton**, **Builder**, **Facade**, and **Factory** patterns, among others. These patterns help simplify the initialization and management of various Spark components while making it easier for developers to interact with Spark’s powerful distributed data processing capabilities. Each pattern contributes to `SparkSession` being a highly flexible, scalable, and user-friendly entry point for Spark applications.
