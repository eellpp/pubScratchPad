There’s a popular implementation of the Mediator pattern that relies on Observer. The mediator object plays the role of publisher, and the components act as subscribers which subscribe to and unsubscribe from the mediator’s events. When Mediator is implemented this way, it may look very similar to Observer.

The **Mediator** and **Observer** patterns are both behavioral design patterns, but they serve different purposes. However, there is a popular implementation of the **Mediator** pattern that uses the **Observer** pattern internally, which can make them look quite similar. Let's break down the concepts and explain how they overlap in this particular implementation.

### Mediator Pattern Overview
- **Purpose:** The **Mediator** pattern is used to reduce direct dependencies between objects by introducing a mediator object that handles communication between them. Instead of objects communicating directly with each other, they send messages or events to the mediator, which then relays these to the appropriate recipients.

- **Structure:**
  - **Mediator:** The central object that coordinates communication between other objects.
  - **Colleagues (Components):** Objects that communicate with each other through the mediator.

### Observer Pattern Overview
- **Purpose:** The **Observer** pattern defines a one-to-many relationship between objects, where one object (the subject) notifies multiple observers (subscribers) about events.

- **Structure:**
  - **Subject (Publisher):** Maintains a list of observers and notifies them of changes.
  - **Observers (Subscribers):** Objects that are notified when the subject changes or when an event occurs.

### Mediator with Observer Implementation

In some implementations, the **Mediator** pattern is designed in such a way that it uses the **Observer** pattern to manage the communication between components. Here's how that works:

1. **Mediator as Publisher:**
   - The mediator acts as a central hub or a publisher. It defines events or messages that can be triggered by different components (colleagues).

2. **Components as Subscribers:**
   - The components register themselves with the mediator as subscribers to specific events. When a particular event occurs, the mediator notifies the relevant components (subscribers) about the event.

3. **Communication via Events:**
   - When one component wants to communicate with another, it doesn't do so directly. Instead, it triggers an event in the mediator. The mediator then notifies all the subscribers interested in that event.

### Example Scenario

Imagine a chat room application where users can send messages to the room. The chat room is the mediator, and the users are the components.

- **Without Observer:** The chat room (mediator) would have direct references to all users and would call specific methods on each user to deliver messages.

- **With Observer:** The chat room (mediator) uses the observer pattern to allow users to subscribe to message events. When a message is sent to the chat room, it triggers an event, and all subscribed users are notified via the observer mechanism.

### How They Look Similar

When the **Mediator** pattern is implemented using the **Observer** pattern:

- The **Mediator** (chat room) is playing the role of the **Subject** (publisher) in the **Observer** pattern.
- The **Colleagues** (users) act as **Observers** (subscribers), subscribing to events managed by the mediator.
- The mediator’s role of coordinating communication is fulfilled by managing events and notifying subscribers, which is the core of the **Observer** pattern.

### Key Differences Despite Similarities

- **Intent:**
  - **Mediator:** Aims to decouple components by centralizing communication logic.
  - **Observer:** Aims to provide a way for multiple objects to react to changes or events in another object.

- **Focus:**
  - **Mediator:** Focuses on reducing the complexity of inter-object communication by centralizing it.
  - **Observer:** Focuses on notifying multiple objects of changes in a subject.

- **Complexity and Scope:**
  - **Mediator:** Manages the complexity of communication between components, which can include conditional logic, state management, etc.
  - **Observer:** Typically involves simpler notification mechanisms where observers are simply notified of events or changes.

### Conclusion

When the **Mediator** pattern uses the **Observer** pattern internally, the mediator is essentially managing the communication between components through event notifications, which makes the two patterns appear similar. However, the key difference lies in their purpose: **Mediator** is about centralizing and managing communication, while **Observer** is about establishing a dynamic notification system between objects. Despite their similarities in this implementation, they address different problems and can be distinguished by their intent and scope.
