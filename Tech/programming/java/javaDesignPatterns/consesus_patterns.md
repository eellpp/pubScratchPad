Here's a table outlining design patterns around **eventual consistency** and **strong consistency**, along with examples of popular applications or libraries:

| **Pattern**                          | **Consistency Type**   | **Description**                                                                | **Example Application/Library**                |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Event Sourcing**                   | Eventual Consistency    | Stores state as events, allowing eventual reconciliation across systems         | **EventStore**, **Apache Kafka**              |
| **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** | Eventual Consistency    | Separates write (commands) and read (queries), enabling eventual consistency    | **Axon Framework**, **Lagom**                 |
| **CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types)** | Eventual Consistency    | Ensures consistency across replicas by using data types that automatically resolve conflicts | **Riak**, **Redis**                           |
| **Paxos/Raft Consensus**             | Strong Consistency      | Consensus algorithms ensuring all nodes agree on the order of operations         | **Etcd**, **Consul**, **Apache Zookeeper**    |
| **Two-Phase Commit (2PC)**           | Strong Consistency      | A distributed transaction protocol ensuring atomicity across multiple nodes      | **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**                     |
| **Quorum-based Replication**         | Strong Consistency      | A majority of nodes must agree on reads/writes to ensure consistency             | **Cassandra**, **HBase**                      |

Each pattern is suited to different system requirements depending on the desired trade-offs between availability, fault tolerance, and latency.
