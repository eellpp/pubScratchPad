Hereâ€™s a table of common Java pitfalls that senior developers should be aware of:

| **Issue**                           | **Description**                                                                 | **Example / Result**                                      |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Type Erasure**                    | Generic types are erased at runtime, leading to loss of type info.              | `List<String>` and `List<Integer>` are treated as `List`. |
| **Covariant Arrays**                | Arrays allow incorrect assignments at runtime.                                  | `Object[] arr = new String[10]; arr[0] = 1;` causes an error. |
| **Autoboxing/Unboxing Overhead**    | Implicit conversion between primitives and wrappers can impact performance.     | Frequent `Integer` <-> `int` conversion can be costly.    |
| **Unchecked Exceptions**            | Generics can result in unchecked warnings or potential class cast exceptions.    | Suppressed warnings might mask real bugs.                 |
| **Floating-point Precision**        | Floating-point calculations can lose precision.                                 | Use `BigDecimal` for accurate financial calculations.     |
| **Memory Leaks in Static Fields**   | Static fields hold objects for the lifetime of the class, potentially leaking memory. | Large objects in static fields can cause memory bloat.   |
| **Deadlocks in Multi-threading**    | Improper synchronization can cause deadlocks.                                   | Two threads waiting on each other to release locks.       |
| **Mutable Objects in Hash Maps**    | Changing an object used as a key in hash-based collections breaks the collection. | Hash code changes invalidate the collection's integrity.  |
| **Finalization Issues**             | Relying on `finalize()` can lead to resource leaks.                             | Use `try-with-resources` for proper resource management.  |
| **ClassLoader Memory Leaks**        | Improper use of class loaders in dynamic applications can cause memory leaks.    | Web applications might retain memory after redeployment. |
| **Overuse of Synchronization**      | Excessive synchronization can lead to performance bottlenecks.                  | Slows down the system due to contention on locks.         |
| **Improper Equals/HashCode Override**| Inconsistent `equals`/`hashCode` implementations can lead to incorrect behavior in collections. | Objects may behave incorrectly in `HashMap` or `HashSet`.|
| **Exceptions in Static Initializers**| Exceptions in static blocks can prevent class loading and initialization.        | May cause runtime `ExceptionInInitializerError`.          |

This table highlights pitfalls that can result in runtime errors, performance degradation, or incorrect application behavior in Java development.
