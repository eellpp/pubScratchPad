**Type erasure** is a mechanism in Java that removes generic type information at runtime. It means that during compilation, generic types (like `<T>`) are replaced with their raw types (like `Object`). This is done to maintain backward compatibility with older versions of Java that didn't support generics.

For example, `List<String>` and `List<Integer>` are treated as `List` at runtime, and all type-specific information is erased. This can cause issues like not being able to check the generic type at runtime (e.g., `instanceof` with generics).

An example of an issue caused by type erasure is the inability to differentiate between generic types at runtime. Consider the following code:

```java
public static void checkListType(List<String> stringList, List<Integer> intList) {
    if (stringList instanceof List<String>) {
        System.out.println("This is a list of strings");
    }
}
```

Due to type erasure, the `instanceof` check will fail because `List<String>` and `List<Integer>` are both erased to `List<?>` at runtime. This makes it impossible to determine the actual type of the list.

### How to Avoid:
1. **Use bounded wildcards or specific class objects** to maintain some control over types.
2. **Pass `Class<T>` as an argument** to retrieve specific types in cases like deserialization or reflection.

Hereâ€™s a correct usage of how to avoid issues due to type erasure by passing a `Class<T>`:

```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MyClass {
  public static <T> T getTypedValue(List<?> list, Class<T> clazz) {
    for (Object item : list) {
        if (clazz.isInstance(item)) {
            return clazz.cast(item);
        }
    }
    return null;
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    List<Object> mixedList = Arrays.asList("Joe Doe", 123, 45.67);
    
    String stringValue = getTypedValue(mixedList, String.class);  // Works fine
    Integer intValue = getTypedValue(mixedList, Integer.class);   // Works fine
     System.out.println("String = " + stringValue);
     System.out.println("Integer = " + intValue);
}
}
```

In this example, passing the `Class<T>` helps to preserve type safety and avoid runtime errors due to type erasure.
