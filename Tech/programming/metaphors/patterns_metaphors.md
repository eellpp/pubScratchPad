Here is the table format with the concepts, metaphors, and their short descriptions:

| **Concept**        | **Metaphor**                | **Description**                                                                          |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Abstraction**     | Car Steering Wheel         | You don’t need to understand how the car’s complex systems work internally; you just use the wheel and pedals to control the car. This is simplified interaction with hidden complexity, which is the essence of abstraction.                |
| **Interface**       | A Contract                  | You sign a contract of the services you will provide |
| **Interface**       | Electric Plug and Socket    | Standard connection point to access electricity, without needing to know how it’s generated.|
| **Interface**       | Restaurant Menu             | A menu provides available options without showing how the food is prepared.               |
| **Inheritance**     | Family Traits               | Children inherit traits from parents, just like a class inherits properties from another. |
| **Encapsulation**   | Pill Capsule                    | The capsule contains medicine inside, but you can’t see or directly interact with the medicine. You just swallow the pill, and it works inside your body. The contents (medicine) are encapsulated within the pill, and you don’t need to know the details of how it’s prepared or what exactly is inside—it’s protected from the outside.|
| **Polymorphism**    | Different Vehicles, Same Action | Different vehicles can all be "driven" even though each works differently.              |
| **Encoding**        |Translating a Message in secret code       |In UTF-8 encoding, the letter 'A' is encoded as the binary sequence 01000001. |
|**Process**          |A worker on a task          |A worker is assigned a task and when its finished they report back. Then you can stop the work or start him on a new task|
|**Deamon**            |A night watchman            |You dont directly interact with watchman. They are always present doing they job. If there are issues they report back and continue watching. Eg web server|
|**Service**          |A restaurant wait staff      | He is always waiting. But wating for instruction and then will response. A nightwatchman (deamon) is autonomous does not wait for instruction.|
|**actuator**          | A light Switch              |An actuator is like a light switch in your home. When you flip the switch, it triggers an action (turning the light on or off), converting your simple physical action into an electrical response. Spring boot actuator can do actions on app like shut down, refresh configs unlike pure REST API endpoint that provides app service but does not change the app |
|**Checked Exception** |A detour while driving car    | The detour doesn’t mean your car is broken or that you can’t continue driving, but it requires you to change your path temporarily. You handle this situation by taking the alternate route and continuing your journey.|
|**Unchecked Exceptions**| Engine failure in car      | A unchecked exception like Runtime Exception is like an unrecoverable error. If engine failure car cannot run. If memory overflow etc the app cannot run |
|**Archive**            |Old books stored in vault    | Old books can be stored in vault because they are not accessed so often. A backup on the other hand is a copy of original book|
|**vault**              | A Bank Vault | Access is strictly controlled. In software vault the data itself may or may not be encrypted but access is strictly controlled and audited. The credentials may be auto renewed periodically etc. A plain encrypted data at rest can be accessed by anyone and credentials change cannot be monitored etc|
|**assertion**          | security checkpoint at airport | if assertion is true the process can continue else throws error     |
|**baseline**          | timing achieved while training for marathon   | baseline is timing achieved while training and benchmark the best time recorded in past for actual marathon |




This table captures the concepts, metaphors, and their concise explanations in an easy-to-read format.
