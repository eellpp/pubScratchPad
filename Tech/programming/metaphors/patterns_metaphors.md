Here is the table format with the concepts, metaphors, and their short descriptions:

| **Concept**        | **Metaphor**                | **Description**                                                                          |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Abstraction**     | Car Steering Wheel         | You don’t need to understand how the car’s complex systems work internally; you just use the wheel and pedals to control the car. This is simplified interaction with hidden complexity, which is the essence of abstraction.                |
| **Interface**       | A Contract                  | You sign a contract of the services you will provide |
| **Interface**       | Electric Plug and Socket    | Standard connection point to access electricity, without needing to know how it’s generated.|
| **Interface**       | Restaurant Menu             | A menu provides available options without showing how the food is prepared.               |
| **Inheritance**     | Family Traits               | Children inherit traits from parents, just like a class inherits properties from another. |
| **Encapsulation**   | Pill Capsule                    | The capsule contains medicine inside, but you can’t see or directly interact with the medicine. You just swallow the pill, and it works inside your body. The contents (medicine) are encapsulated within the pill, and you don’t need to know the details of how it’s prepared or what exactly is inside—it’s protected from the outside.|
| **Polymorphism**    | Different Vehicles, Same Action | Different vehicles can all be "driven" even though each works differently.              |
| **Encoding**        |Translating a Message in secret code       |In UTF-8 encoding, the letter 'A' is encoded as the binary sequence 01000001. |

This table captures the concepts, metaphors, and their concise explanations in an easy-to-read format.
