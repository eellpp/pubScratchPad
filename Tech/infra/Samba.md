The **Samba architecture** model is built to provide interoperability between Linux/Unix systems and Windows, functioning as both a file and print server, and an **Active Directory (AD)-compatible domain controller**.

### Core Components:
1. **SMB/CIFS**: Handles file and printer sharing.
2. **nmbd**: Provides NetBIOS name service, enabling network browsing.
3. **smbd**: Manages file and print services.
4. **winbindd**: Integrates Unix/Linux systems with Windows domain accounts.
5. **LDAP, Kerberos, and DNS**: Used when Samba operates as an AD domain controller, for authentication and directory services.

This architecture allows seamless integration in heterogeneous networks.

Unlike **Active Directory (AD)**, **Samba** does not directly follow the same object-based architecture with **Organizational Units (OUs), trees, and forests**. However, when Samba operates as an **Active Directory Domain Controller**, it emulates AD by implementing **LDAP** (for directory services), **Kerberos** (for authentication), and **DNS** (for name resolution). 

You can visualize Samba's architecture like this:
- **Domain Controller**: Provides central authentication and directory services.
- **LDAP Directory**: Contains user, group, and machine objects.
- **Kerberos**: Manages authentication tickets.
- **SMB/CIFS Protocol**: Facilitates file and printer sharing.

Samba can act similarly to AD but doesn't have the exact hierarchical OU-tree-forest model; instead, it focuses on directory services integration with a **flat structure** for smaller domains or simple AD domain setups.

## Small Company Example
Let’s consider a small company, **TechStart**, using **Samba** as an Active Directory Domain Controller (AD DC) to integrate both Linux and Windows systems.

### Scenario:

- **TechStart.local** is the company’s domain, and Samba is set up as the **primary domain controller** (PDC).
- **LDAP** stores user and group information such as **employees** and **departments** (e.g., IT, HR, and Sales).
- **Kerberos** handles authentication, ensuring that all users authenticate against a central authority.
- **SMB/CIFS** allows file and printer sharing between Linux and Windows systems.
  
The structure is **flat**, meaning Samba has no concept of **Organizational Units (OUs), trees, or forests**, unlike traditional AD, but it functions similarly by storing users, computers, and policies in its LDAP directory. **TechStart** manages all network resources and user authentication centrally through Samba, ensuring secure file sharing and identity management across their hybrid (Linux and Windows) infrastructure.
