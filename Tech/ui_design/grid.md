In web design, the vertical grid is more important and easily identifiable than the horizontal grid. This is due to the nature of web design and the concept that page height is greatly dependent on the length of the content.   

Most website grid structures use a 12-column grid, although there is no specific requirement for the number of columns. A website grid also has consistent spacing between each column, known as gutters, and spacing outside of the grid, known as margins.  

Not only does the grid ensure the aspects of a design are consistently spaced, it allows us to use a global foundation for creating webpages and templates rather than placing everything by hand. The benefit of this is not only consistency but efficiency as well.

The developer can configure the grid structure once, or as needed, to create the base structure on which the entire site will be built. This also helps with responsive design by allowing the designer and developer to more easily determine the behavior of elements by deciding how many columns they should span on certain device sizes and how they should be aligned within their bounding box.
