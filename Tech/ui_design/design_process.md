### Idea and Concept
A product idea is “an idea for a possible product that the company can see itself offering to the market” (Kotler 2017). ... A product concept is “a detailed version of the new-product idea stated in meaningful consumer terms” (Kotler 2017).  

Business Idea: I would like to start a hotel chain.  
Business Concept: A line of affordable hotels that caters to a broad range of customers needs including families, seniors and pet owners.  

You have a defined target audience and plan to focus on providing affordable rooms. You could, upon further research, add other things like family-frequented hotels to feature play areas for kids and so on.

### Design

`Wireframe`    
Wireframe is a low-fidelity way to present a product, can efficiently outline structures and layouts. Wireframe is the basic and visual representation of the design. Your wireframe design doesn’t need to focus too much on minutiae, but must express design ideas and should not miss any important parts.A wireframe is like a channel that helps team member understand their projects better.  

`Mockup`  
Mockup, a kind of high-fidelity static design diagram, should demonstrate information frames and statically present content and functions. Unlike a wireframe,a mockup looks more like a finished product or prototype, but it is not interactive and not clickable. It is rather a graphic representation. This can be helpful, for example, to provide investors with a picture of how a finished product can be,and help team members review their project visually.

`Prototype`  
A prototype is often a high fidelity representation of the final product which is meant to simulate user interaction. Unlike the previous two, a prototype is clickable and thus allows the user to experience content and interactions in the interface. In fact, a prototype is very much like the final product itself.  
But it’s not the final product!  
The difference between the final product and the prototype is mainly that the interface and the backend are not often tied together in the case of a prototype. This is done to reduce development costs until the UI is approved. Once the prototype is tested, the team can go on with coding.

### Development
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle  

1. Pre Alpha : daily builds
2. Alpha :   
Alpha software is not thoroughly tested by the developer before it is released to customers. Alpha software may contain serious errors, and any resulting instability could cause crashes or data loss.Alpha software may not contain all of the features that are planned for the final version     

3. Beta  
A beta phase generally begins when the software is feature complete but likely to contain a number of known or unknown bugs  

4. Release Candidate  
A release candidate (RC), also known as "going silver", is a beta version with potential to be a stable product, which is ready to release unless significant bugs emerge.  

5. Release to Marketing
6. General Availability
7. Production Release

### Proof of Concept
During product planning or design, there may be bottlenecks where success relies on a component or section of the application, but this is currently hypothetical. When you need real world results, a PoC is the most efficient way to get firm answers.  
Scale isn’t the issue - PoCs exist to simply showcase if something is possible.  

There are also times when a Proof of Concept simply isn’t needed. For example, if you’re using technologies and designs that have more or less been done before. In these cases, their existence more or less demonstrates the validity. A PoC is best used in cases where there is the most risk, uncertainty or potential impact on the final product.  


Pilot Project are PoCs projects that focus on providing an unrefined and unfinished version of a product, often just focusing on some essential functionality (but not all, this is not a prototype or MVP) for testing and feedback.
