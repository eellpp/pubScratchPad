This is a compilation of transcripts of talks that I find interesting. I learn better when I read something rather than hearing it, and I have a hunch that I'm not the only one who feels that way. So I thought I'd make the talks more accessible to anyone for whom listening to the talks might not be the most viable or simply not the most preferred option.
