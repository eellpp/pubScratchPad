Very Good

## Showing a version of the page
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-appsawg-json-patch-10#autoid-10

The impressive feature is the right column which has tabs : Info , Contents. and Prefs.  
Each of the tab is rich in its content 

The design of the page at [IETF Data Tracker for JSON Patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-appsawg-json-patch-10#autoid-10) stands out for a few reasons:

1. **Minimalist and Functional Design**: The page follows a simple and functional design with a clean, text-heavy layout, keeping distractions to a minimum. It focuses on readability and presenting technical details without unnecessary visual elements.

2. **Monospaced Font for Code Blocks**: The page effectively uses a monospaced font for code examples and protocol instructions, which makes it easy to distinguish code from regular text. This reinforces the page's technical and professional tone.

3. **Structured Document Outline**: The page uses a structured outline with headings (auto-generated IDs) that help navigate the document easily. The headings create a logical flow, making it easier for users to jump between sections without confusion.

4. **Hyperlinked Table of Contents**: The document includes a table of contents with hyperlinks that allow users to jump directly to specific sections. This is essential for long technical documents like RFCs and drafts.

5. **Focus on Standards and Drafts**: The page format highlights its purpose as a technical standards document. It presents information in a structured, formal manner consistent with other RFC and draft documents, which builds trust in its accuracy and authority.
