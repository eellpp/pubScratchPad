#### What is the difference between UTF-8 and ISO-8859-1?
UTF-8 is a multibyte encoding that can represent any Unicode character. ISO 8859-1 is a single-byte encoding that can represent the first 256 Unicode characters. Both encode ASCII exactly the same way.

Both are supported in JAVA StandardCharactersets
