> When examined in this simple light, many of the use cases currently under discussion do not make sense. The biggest problem tends to be confidentiality. The participants in a fiercely competitive marketplace will naturally prefer the privacy of a centralized database, rather than reveal their activities to each other. This is especially true if a trusted central party already exists and can provide the neutral territory in which that database can reside. Even though there may be some cost associated with this central provider, this is more than justified by the value of the privacy retained. The only motivation for a shift to blockchains would be aggressive new regulation.

> Nonetheless blockchains do have strong use cases, where disintermediation and robustness are more important than confidentiality and performance. I’ll write more about these in a subsequent post, but the most promising areas we’ve seen so far are: (a) inter-company audit trails, (b) provenance tracking, and (c) lightweight financial systems. In all three cases, we’ve found people building on MultiChain with a clear view to deployment, rather than just curiosity and experimentation. So if you’re looking for ways in which blockchains can add genuine value to your business, they might be a good place to start.

## BlockChain Concepts

Bitcoin != blockchain\
Bitcoin is the incentive for the miners to keep building blockchain blocks.
- distributed : Cheap decentralized machines can become nodes. Entire blockchain size in 2018 for bitcoin is around 200 GB which can easily be kept on any cheap machine.
- consesus based : Majority of nodes must agree on transcations for the block to valid. Once a node validates the newly added block, it start to compute the key for the new block on top so as to be the first one to do so.
- immutable : Past blocks cannot be changed. Only appending is possible
- proof of work : Each miner need to compute a random number which is a key to join the existing block to new block. The first one to do so earns the commision.

Global diamond giant De Beers announced Thursday that it tracked 100 high-value diamonds from the mine to the retailer using blockchain technology. The effort was reportedly undertaken to enhance consumer confidence and public trust that De Beers diamonds were non-conflict, in addition to increasing efficiency in the supply chain. Conflict diamonds are uncut diamonds mined in a war-zone and traded to illicitly fund the fighting.

Tracr assigns a unique “Global Diamond ID” which records individual diamond characteristics such as carat, clarity, and color. The data is then consolidated onto an immutable digital ledger. Tracr then verifies said data at each milestone of the diamond’s movement from the mine to the retailer.

Walmart IBM tracking food with blockchain
> At each stop along the way, people handling produce for Walmart will make an entry on the blockchain, signing off when they receive it and then when they move it onto the next person in the chain. IBM and Walmart say they are already tracking other products like yogurt and poultry on the system. 

> Blockchains are supposed to make it possible to keep updated databases without any central authority in charge. But currently, all of the records for the Walmart blockchain are being stored on IBM’s cloud computers, for Walmart’s use. That has led to questions about why a distributed database like a blockchain is even necessary
