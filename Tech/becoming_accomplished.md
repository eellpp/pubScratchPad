### Becoming accomplished
All worlds an art  
The art is in pursuit and not in results.  
Never mind the failures and novice attempts. For others they appear wasteful but for an artist the effort is precious.  

After 2 decades of experience, the master in tech in should have enough experience to build something on his own. From beginning to end.  
Like a builder, 
- he can fit the architecture to physical/social/practical and economical constraints while still making it the best in class to stand out.  
- he is getting things done, but know how to do it himself in case the need arises
- he forsees problems in selected approach and meticulously avoids them by designing around them

For tech:  
- accomplishment on tools and practices or a preferred tech stack
- infrastructure, deployment and troubleshooting for the app
- marketing, sales and customer support
- leadership and team building
