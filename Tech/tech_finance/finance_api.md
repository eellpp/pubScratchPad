The basic idea is to invest/use most of your net worth in “safe” investments, those primarily keeping up with inflation or just barely beating it. If shit hits the fan, you have a cushion to fall back on.   
Anything beyond keeping you safe and comfortable enough should go chasing the highest returns possible. So you can partake in as much upside as possible.  
Startup comp follows this logic. Enough salary to fund your life and basic savings, equity to chase high upside.
