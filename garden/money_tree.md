Your Money Tree prefers deep but infrequent watering. Water your Money Tree when the top 50%-75% of the soil is dry. Water the plant until it runs from the drainage holes and discard any excess water from the saucer. To prevent root rot, make sure your plant is never standing in water. Be sure to turn your Money Tree each time you water to allow for even growth and leaf development. Your Money Tree requires less water in the winter months when growth slows.  

Feed once a month in the spring and summer when it is producing new leaves with a water-soluble, well-balanced plant food at half the recommended strength, such as our All Purpose Fertilizer (20-20-20). No fertilizer is necessary during the winter when plant growth naturally slows. Always make sure the soil is damp before applying any fertilizer.  


### leaves on your Money Tree could be turning yellow for a number of reasons
The most common cause of yellowing leaves among Money Trees is improper soil moisture from overwatering in particular  

Low humidity and dry soil can cause leaves to droop and brown on their edges, which can later be followed by entire leaves turning yellow, brown, or shed completely  

Your Money Tree will grow best when placed in bright indirect sunlight, but it will tolerate medium light. When exposed to direct sunlight for too long, the foliage will burn, so be sure to avoid placing your Money Tree in direct sun.
