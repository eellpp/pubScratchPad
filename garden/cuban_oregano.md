PLECTRANTHUS TOMENTOSA CUBAN OREGANO  

Cooks around the world use it in everything from black bean soup to pasta sauce to pulled pork dishes.

Whether itâ€™s grown indoors or out, its potent oils help to protect it from many pests and diseases.  

Full sun or bright light  

Succulents have a high content of water storage in their leaves.  
Check and water the plants when the soil become dry.  
Water the soil thoroughly and let it drain out from the bottom of the pot.  
Let the soil get completely dry before watering again.  

Feed with organic fertilizer once a month to encourage growth  

### Trimming  
A good general rule of thumb is to cut about half of the main stem off, enjoying those leaves in your cooking. This will encourage bushy growth instead of tall, leggy, potentially unstable growth.  
As lateral stems grow, you can cut off one-third to one-half of each stem at a time, taking care not to remove too many stem portions at once. Always leave a good two-thirds of the plant intact and let it grow unfettered for two weeks in between major cuttings.
