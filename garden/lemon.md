While lemon trees are quite hardy, growing them (or any plant) in a pot presents its own set of challenges. Pots heat up quicker in the sun, as well as cool off quicker in excessive cold. This makes potted plants more susceptible to heat and cold stress than those growing in garden beds. Because they are more susceptible to dry-out they need more regular watering which results in the leaching of nutrients from the potting mix. This means they usually need more fertiliser as well  

### Soil
The proportion of soil does not have to be very strict. Basically, it is loose and airy, with sufficient nutrients. You can use leaf mulch, add a quarter of the river sand, part of the garden soil, and add a small amount of decomposed organic fertilizer.

### Maintainance 
Potted lemons are generally in spring, and it is most suitable to change soil and flower pots in March and April. Apply some base fertilizer to the bottom of the pot soil. It also needs to be pruned in spring, cut off some long branches, old branches, and diseased branches so that it can bloom and bear fruit. Watering should be controlled well, and the pot soil should be watered in time when it is dry.

### Sun
Don't expose potted lemons to the sun in summer. If the temperature is higher than 30 degrees, you should shade them for several hours at noon. Before flowering and after fruiting, fertilize regularly. Some cake fertilizer, green manure, and organic fertilizer are all fine. This way the fruit can grow big.


Select a dwarf variety of lemon tree, such as ‘Lots A’ Lemons’.

### Pot Size 
Select a pot not less than 40cm wide for your new citrus tree. After a couple of years, it will probably need repotting into a 60cm pot. Your tree should then happily remain in its pot, but replace the potting mix every few years if the tree starts to look tired.  

Potted lemons are restricted by flower pots. Unlike lemons grown in open fields, potted lemons need to change the soil once a year, and replace a larger flower pot. Although lemons are not strict to the soil, the soil is deep, loose and fertile, rich in organic matter, good moisture retention, strong fertility retention, and slightly acidic soil with a PH value of 6.5 is the most suitable.
