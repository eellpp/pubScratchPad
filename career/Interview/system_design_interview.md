Think of a system design interview as a brainstorming session, driven by open-ended questions, in which you’ll be expected to competently discuss a complex system. Consider it an opportunity to work with your interviewer, just as two team members would, to solve a real problem related to the company’s goals.  

 You’ll should be able to methodically explore different directions, ask the right questions, and understand best practices and common pitfalls of modern software systems.

Actual experience with a wide range of tools and systems is an advantage, but being able to identify a need and suggest a common solution for it would get you a long way, even if you’ve never used it yourself.
