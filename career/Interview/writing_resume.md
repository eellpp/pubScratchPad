The purpose of your technical resume is to generate interview requests  

Here are a few things a technical resume is not:  
- Not your autobiography
- Not a comprehensive catalog of everything you’ve done
- Not a way to make you feel good about yourself (though it might also do that)
- Not an academic CV
- Not where you need to explain past ‘bad situations’
- Not where you need to explain why you left prior jobs

A technical resume’s primary purpose is to generate interview requests for you  
- It’s to make it as clear as possible which types of problems you’ve solved in the past, and how well you solved them.  


### Asking the right Questions
for the technology you were working on, how did it make your company, team, or systems better? Did it increase, decrease, grow, shrink, improve, suppress, optimize, deprecate, add or remove something important for your company? For everything you’ve worked on, there was some reason you were doing it. Hopefully, that reason had to do with making things better. Share the result with your resume readers.  

### Quantify 
You should quantify your achievements as much as possible. And yes, the popular pattern "Accomplished X, as measured by Y, by doing Z" is effective.
 
So the more you can use numbers to quantify how much you helped increase, decrease, grow, shrink, etc., the important metrics in your prior roles, the better and more persuasive your resume will be in getting picked out of the pile.

- “Reduced AWS bill by 40% by profiling server code and implementing strategic optimizations”
- “Architected cloud backend to support 500,000 daily users”
- “Reduced average page load time by 57% percent”

 If you increased something by 50% what technologies or solutions or methodologies did you use to get there? If you shrank a different metric by 70%, what activities or behaviors or actions did you need to take to achieve this reduction?  
 
 
### Work in teams where metrics are used to drive decisions
The exact number is irrelevant, the fact that there is a number is relevant. That means the developer not only understood the business requirements but also measured the impact afterwards. That's a very valuable skill in many companies that use metrics to make decisions.  

### Self tracking
A lot of companies are not data-driven enough. But with OKRs and behavioral interviewing, the trend is towards companies and interview processes being more data driven.  
I'd suggest that this makes it more important for you to track numbers. You're responsible for your own career - your current employer certainly isn't concerned about where you will be 10 years from now.  

My recommendation would be, from now on, to keep an eye on the 3 - 5 metrics you can realistically help in moving in a year. Track the numbers independently if possible. It matters much more to your career than to your company, and helps you share a story about your capabilities to future bosses and employers.  

### Interview questions based on resume claim 
Resume : Designed and implemented GraphQL API for 30 objects serving 200 Queries per second  

Expected Interview questions:  
* Can you tell more about the GraphQL API? Was this new or replacing an API? Tell me about the constraints and goals you were working towards?
* What issues did you have getting to that level of performance? What trade-offs did you make when you hit issues?
* What are the challenges with running your API in production?
* Can the API you implemented scale higher? If so, what would need to be changed with it as you scale to 400 and 1200 queries per second?

If this person has done the work this should be a good discussion and you can start to bring in some of your business or technical problems. It will be very evident whether someone has just invented metrics, or the statement is describing the work of others.
