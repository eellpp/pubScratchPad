> As someone who has interviewed with 3 of those 6 companies and gotten offers from all 3, I think the best way to approach these interviews is to not walk in with the mentality that it's a one sided "test" where you are put on a spot to defend yourself.
In reality it's more often than not a role-playing exercise where you are pretending to be coworkers trying to solve problems together. Sure you'd be the one leading the problem solving, but being capable to explain your thought process effectively, having the ability to exchange ideas with the interviewer, and just being able to come across as a good teammate is probably more important than getting that last 5% of optimization.
> This is especially more true for senior level position interviews where there are more design/architecture problems with relatively open answers. Out of these companies Google felt most impersonal and "test like", which I guess is not a surprise considering they mostly don't hire for any specific teams/positions (and we can debate the pros/cons of that all we want), and they try to eliminate human factors by the way of having hiring committees (which leads to other pros/cons).
> In the end even though most still comes down to the technical skills, walking in with the right mentality and attitude actually really helps one to emphasize one's strengths.
> Oh one last thing, showing confidence is also super important. But too many people mistake arrogance for confidence. In my personal experience there is no better way to demonstrate confidence than being comfortable (not to be confused with complacency) with what you don't know, and showing intellectual curiosity/eagerness to learn.

> You should be comfortable with all the basic algorithms. This is not for the reason, that it could be asked in interview (Infact its silly on part of interviewer to ask impliment a well known algo). This is so that problem solving involves identifying patterns to what you already know. 

> Every time I run `rm -r` for example!, i am intracting with tree searching algorithms. You interact with them everyday

> Asking algorithmic interview questions is also a form of “proof of work”. If you are willing to go to the lengths of learning these things, maybe you’ll be able to learn other things that are harder to assess during an interview.
