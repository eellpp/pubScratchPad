### Group game

#### I am going to []
Have your students sit in a large circle.  One student begins by saying “I’m going to the [beach, store, school, etc.] and I’m bringing [an object you would bring with you.] The next person repeats the phrase, the first item and adds an item of their own. The game continues around the circle until someone forgets an item or recalls them out of order, or until you reach your time limit.

#### Card Recall
Students pair up with a deck of cards. Partner #1 flips five cards face up and gives Partner #2 a few seconds to look at them. Then, Partner #2 then closes his or her eyes as Partner #1 removes one of the five cards. Finally, Partner #2 opens his or her eyes and has to recall which card is missing.
