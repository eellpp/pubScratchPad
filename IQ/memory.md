> I had once read that the average person squanders about forty days a year compensating for things he or she has forgotten.
In corporate environment, this happens very often. People make the same mistakes and then rediscover the same solution over and over again leading to opportunity loss

> What you have to understand is that even average memories are remarkably powerful if used properly. It’s all about technique and understanding how the memory works. ANyone could do it. 

“The brain is like a muscle,” he said, and memory training is a form of mental workout. Over time, like any form of exercise, it’ll make the brain fitter, quicker, and more nimble.

The nonlinear associative nature of our brains makes it impossible for us to consciously search our memories in an orderly way. A memory only pops directly into consciousness if it is cued by some other thought or perception—some other node in the nearly limitless interconnected web. 

> S kept his memories rigidly organized by mapping them onto structures and places he already knew well. One image might be placed at the doorway of a house, another near a streetlamp, another on top of a picket fence, another in a garden, another on the ledge of a store window. All this happened in his mind’s eye as effortlessly as if he were placing real objects along a real street. When S wanted to recall the information a day, month, year, or decade later, all he would have to do was rewalk the path where that particular set of memories was stored, and he would see each image in the precise spot where he originally left it

To properly encode a memory, you must first be paying attention. Since you cannot pay attention to everything all the time, most of what you encounter every day is simply filtered out.

### Experts in a field
Pick any field of human endeavor like doctors, baseball fans, violinists, soccer players, snooker players, ballet dancers, abacus wranglers, crossword puzzlers, volleyball defenders and you would find others amazed by the exceptional memories possessed by experts in that field.

Experts see the world differently. They notice things that nonexperts don’t see. They home in on the information that matters most, and have an almost automatic sense of what to do with it. And most important, experts process the enormous amounts of information flowing through their senses in more sophisticated ways.

### Memory Types

`Sensory memory` — This is where we store our first impressions of sights, sounds, and touch. Sensory memory is unlimited, and we can store vast amounts of sensory input.

`Long-term memory` — This is where we store information for longer periods of time, anywhere from thirty seconds to a lifetime. Long-term memory is unlimited in capacity. When you teach, you want your child to store the information you introduce in her long-term memory.

`Short-term memory` — This can be divided into immediate memory and working memory. It is a temporary holding place for new information that comes in through sensory memory. Short-term memory then pays attention to some of that input and integrates it into long-term memory.
The capacity of short- term memory is more like three to four “chunks” of information. For example, we remember phone numbers in groupings: the first three numbers, then the last four numbers.

Working memory is critical for learning, as this initial repository of information. Research has shown that working memory is actually a much better indicator than IQ is of how easily a person can learn.

### Memory Funnel
You can imagine learning as the process of passing information through a funnel. The ones that pass through the funnel are retained in long term memory.

When you are learning something where a lot of distinct new concepts are introduced, then the working memory gets overloaded and either dumps the information entirely or is only able to store fragmented peices of information.

However, if the information is structured in a way to provide a context through which they get connected to each other easily, then the distinct peices of information pass through the funnel as a single context. eg: 10 different words, but which are related to food from morning to evening, for specific regions of world etc.

Use analogies to make connections for new information to what already exists in brain.

### Stages of memory
1. Encoding

- Visual (Image)
- Acoustic (Sound)
- Semantic (Meaning)

2. Storage
3. Retrieval

Evidence suggests that acoustic is the principle coding system in short-term memory (STM) is acoustic coding.  When a person is presented with a list of numbers and letters, they will try to hold them in STM by rehearsing them (verbally).  Rehearsal is a verbal process regardless of whether the list of items is presented acoustically (someone reads them out), or visually (on a sheet of paper).

The principle encoding system in long-term memory (LTM) appears to be semantic coding (by meaning).  However, information in LTM can also be coded both visually and acoustically.

STM is stored and retrieved sequentially.  For example, if a group of participants are given a list of words to remember, and then asked to recall the fourth word on the list, participants go through the list in the order they heard it in order to retrieve the information.

LTM is stored and retrieved by `association`.  This is why you can remember what you went upstairs for if you go back to the room where you first thought about it.

### Multisensory perception
It seems logical that learning begins with the brain, but it doesn’t. Learning actually begins with your senses: sight, sound, touch, smell, and taste. When we teach reading, we can engage three senses: sight, sound, and touch.
The more receptors you involve, the better the chance that the information will be retained by the brain.

Three sensory pathways to brain
- Hands on learning (Kinesthetic)
- Visual
- Audio

When we are taught using all three pathways to the brain—the visual, the auditory, and the kinesthetic—they learn even more than when they are taught only through our strongest pathway. Essentially we are making more connections in brain when learning in multisensory way.

### Working memory or Short term memory (STM)
Memories of visual images (e.g., dinner plates) are stored in what is called visual memory. Our minds use visual memory to perform even the simplest of computations; from remembering the face of someone we’ve just met, to remembering what time it was last we checked.

Memories like what you had for dinner are stored in visual short-term memory—particularly, in a kind of short-term memory often called “visual working memory.” Visual working memory is where visual images are temporarily stored while your mind works away at other tasks—like a whiteboard on which things are briefly written and then wiped away.



### Associate by Applying contexts to past experience
- If you can connect that image to something else you already know, it increases the chances you'll remember it later
- Provide a context. 
- Build a multisensory association (visual, smell, taste, feelings ..)

Person you saw is a doctor in hospital you aunt works. The medicinal smell of hospital, learned man etc. Try to think of these and form connections

Essentially, the more connections a new memory has to knowledge you have, the more likely it is you'll remember that information. 

We don’t remember isolated facts; we remember things in context. A board of randomly arranged chess pieces has no context—there are no similar boards to compare it to, no past games that it resembles, no ways to meaningfully chunk it. This is challenging for a chess grandmaster to remember. However when seeing a random snapshot of a chess game, they process information differently. They are not seeing the individual peices, but the various connections and patterns. It happens unconsciously. Same with a doctor, a football coach. 

They could take meaningless bits of information, run them through a filter that applied meaning to them, and make that information much stickier.

What we call expertise is really just “vast amounts of knowledge, pattern- based retrieval, and planning mechanisms acquired over many years of experience in the associated domain.” In other words, a great memory isn’t just a by-product of expertise; it is the essence of expertise.



### Dullness is the enemy of strong memory
Monotony collapses time; novelty unfolds it. You can exercise daily and eat healthily and live a long life, while experiencing a short one. If you spend your life sitting in a cubicle and passing papers, one day is bound to blend unmemorably into the next—and disappear. That’s why it’s important to change routines regularly, and take vacations to exotic locales, and have as many new experiences as possible that can serve to anchor our memories. Creating new memories stretches out psychological time, and lengthens our perception of our lives.

To remember something, you have to make it exciting to yourself
>The general idea with most memory techniques is to change whatever boring thing is being inputted into your memory into something that is so colorful, so exciting, and so different from anything you’ve seen before that you can’t possibly forget it. This to associate the memory with feelings, color, sensations. When we get excited, these associations automatically happen. 

### Semantic and Episodic memories
- Episodic memory represents our memory of experiences and specific events in time in a serial form, from which we can reconstruct the actual events that took place at any given point in our lives. Eg: I was doing Y in the first summer after I learned to drive. Z happened the weekend after I landed my first job. We remember events by positioning them in time relative to other events.
- Semantic memeories are general factual knowledge, independent of personal experience and of the spatial/temporal context in which it was acquired. They don't have time and space and free floating. Eg: Sun is a star.

Episodic memory are structured by our memories of events. Event X happened just before the big Paris vacation.  Just as we accumulate memories of facts by integrating them into a network, we accumulate life experiences by integrating them into a web of other chronological memories. The denser the web, the denser the experience of time.

This stickness with time can be used to provide context to information. Eg: a doctor giving pills to patient explains it in order in which it has to be carried out throughout the day.

### Building spatial Association
By evolution we are good a spatial memory. 
> What our early human and hominid ancestors did need to remember was where to find food and resources, and the route home, and which plants were edible and which were poisonous. Those are the sorts of vital memory skills that they depended on every day, and it was—at least in part —in order to meet those demands that human memory evolved as it did.

If we go to a new home and notice all the things there, all the spacial information is similar to amount of words in a novel. Just in matter of minutes we memorise all this spacial information. Our brains are designed by evolution of hunter gatherers to remember spacial information.

 This is why you can remember what you went upstairs for if you go back to the room where you first thought about it. Or when finding the misplaced keys you try to revisit your actions during the day to trigger the memory of placing the key.

### Learn in Chunks
 If you want to learn something, do it in chunks over a period of time. Each time you access that memory again you are increasing its storage strength. 
 
 The spacing intervals are important. Increasing the intervals between learning sessions, and thereby reducing the accessibility of information, actually fosters deeper learning. When you struggle to remember something that you learned a few days ago, you’re forced to work hard and engage with the material more. 

### Phased repetition with Quiz and not with reading
Without review or repetition we are leaving the memory to chance. It may persist or it may not. The review must be phased/timed properly.
When a new concept is introduced, it should be reviewed daily for next few days.Then it can phased out over weeks and months. In this way lots new ideas can accomodated in review. This way the learning is retained for years.

To deepen the long term memory, recall with a short quiz. Try to explain it to a friend. 
- After each learning session, prepare a short quiz to help recall during the next learning session

By phased repetition, recall with quiz, presentation etc we are trying to get the brain work on strategies for deeper learning. 

Learning are never retired. They have to be recalled now and then. You should have a process to go through these in years to come.

### Randomize the recall
Randomize the recall sessions and the pop quiz, so that the brain is forced to learn new strategies to retrieve information.

 So you might study something on Monday, do some follow up on Tuesday, take a quiz on Thursday and then another quiz the following week. The gaps between study should initially be small and gradually increase. You want the memories to be difficult to access, but not impossible (there’s no benefit to studying things a year apart).
 

## Building cues
The information is stored in memory. But to recall that single peice of information, we need a cue. Like an index. Eg: If you tell your friend: "Here is the 20$ i owe you", he may not be able to recall. 20$ is too general and vague term. Instead you would have to provide a cue by telling :"when we went to mall to buy a shirt and my credit card did not work". This cue will trigger the stored memory.

### Memory palace trick
The  “memory palace” technique is espoused by the Greeks and Romans. This involves creating a kind of mental geography — say a walk from your front door out to the street — and using strong imagery to link certain words to key points along your “mental walk.” Again, bizarre and distinctive imagery works best.


## Memory Destroyers

### Strong feelings

While feeding in information, if something happens that arouses strong emotions, then it wipes off the working memory. This can be experimented in daily life

A person who takes every success/failure, every praise/insult, every embarassement/rejection personally and too seriously creates weapons of memory destruction internally. These feelings and their recall will be so strong that they will dilute the subtle cues that recalls other millions of memories. 

Dullness is bad for memory. We need to have sensory experience of new things. But holding traumatic memories of essentially inconsequential things is bad.

### Digital distraction
The news and video world tries to garner attention by accentuating every event irrespective of whether its a statistical outlier. Thus the headlines are always sharp statements that arouses feelings. In ranked forums the top posts will be the one which has got many agitated. 

Thus when between work, if you happen to just wander into these for even just few moments, they cause immense damage to working memory. 
From the monotony of work, we need a distraction. Just get up from seat, walk around or find some other activity which is casual and not emotional.

That our memory of distant past is more clear than of the just happened
>  It suggests something profound: that our memories are not static. Somehow, as memories age, their complexion changes. Each time we think about a memory, we integrate it more deeply into our web of other memories, and therefore make it more stable and less likely to be dislodged.

> Sigmund Freud first noted the curious fact that older memories are often remembered as if captured by a third person holding a camera, whereas more recent events tend to be remembered in the first person, as if through one’s own eyes.

habits form unconscious memories. The consiquence of this are actions which we do instinctively but are hard to reason about as we have no memory of them.

 
### Use different tricks to remember different things
The principle underlying all memory techniques is that our brains don’t remember all types of information equally well. As exceptional as we are at remembering visual imagery (think of the two-picture recognition test), we’re terrible at remembering other kinds of information, like lists of words or numbers. 


Find some spacial memory that excites you and you can imagine it in mind
> To use Simonides’ technique, all one has to do is convert something unmemorable, like a string of numbers or a deck of cards or a shopping list or Paradise Lost, into a series of engrossing visual images and mentally arrange them within an imagined space, and suddenly those forgettable items become unforgettable.

Seperate memory palaces needs to be build to hold different memories
> Dr. Yip Swee Chooi, the effervescent Malaysian memory champ, used his own body parts as loci to help him memorize the entire 56,000-word, 1,774-page Oxford Chinese-English dictionary. One might have dozens, hundreds, perhaps even thousands of memory palaces, each built to hold a different set of memories.



> The crucial thing was to choose a memory palace with which I was intimately familiar

> My first assignment was to begin collecting architecture. Before I could embark on any serious degree of memory training, I first needed a stockpile of memory palaces at my disposal. I went for walks around the neighborhood. I visited friends’ houses, the local playground, Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore, the East Wing of the National Gallery of Art. And I traveled back in time: to my high school, to my elementary school, to the house on Reno Road where my family lived until I was four years old. I focused on wallpaper and the arrangement of furniture. I tried to feel the flooring under my feet. I reminded myself of emotionally resonant incidents that occurred in each room. And then I carved each building up into loci that would serve as cubbyholes for my memories. The goal, as Ed explained it, was to know these buildings so thoroughly—to have such a rich and textured set of associations with every corner of every room—that when it came time to learn some new body of information, I could speed through my palaces, scattering images as quickly as I could sketch them in my imagination. The better I knew the buildings, and the more each felt like home, the stickier my images would be, and the easier it would be to reconstruct them later. Ed figured I’d need about a dozen memory palaces just to begin my training. He has several hundred, a metropolis of mental storehouses.


> To really learn a text, one had to memorize it. As the early-eighteenth-century Dutch poet Jan Luyken put it, “One book, printed in the Heart’s own wax / Is worth a thousand in the stacks.”

> One didn’t just memorize texts; one ruminated on them— chewed them up and regurgitated them like cud—and in the process, became intimate with them in a way that made them one’s own.

>I decided to make memorizing a part of my daily routine.  Each morning, after waking up and having my coffee, but before reading the newspaper or showering or even putting on proper clothes, I sat down behind my desk and tried to spend ten to fifteen minutes working through a poem.

Remembering numbers
> Major System
> PAO System (Person Action Object)
To be maximally memorable, one’s images have to appeal to one’s own sense of what is colorful and interesting.
