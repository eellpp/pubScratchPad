### Mind Map
Generally we have holes in understanding concepts which causes fuzzyness and eventually bad recall. 
A mind map will fill those holes and help recall.

Mind map will connect new concepts to what we already know. Learning inherently involves this. Mind map makes it more explicit. 

`Rules`:

- Mind map contains keywords/tags not statements
- associated notes should contain details

### Notes
Take short notes accompanying the mind map. If its about tech tools , programming lang etc then better take online notes which can be accessed anywhere. For maths and abstract concepts take offline notes in notebook

### Review plan
Each study should come with a review plan. Weekly , monthly etc. While taking notes, prepare some questions and flashcards

## Tools

`Simple Mind` for Mind Map

`Google calendar` for scheduling tests

`Quizlet` , `Anki` for flashcard based review tests

`TopTracker` for project/work timetracking

`Progress Chart`

Simply divide a piece of paper into two columns. At the end of the day, check your records in TopTracker and write down the times on the left side and what youâ€™ve accomplished on the right side. This shows the progress you achieved

### Split learning goals
