`undivided attention` : When you know that someone is talking to you, just clear your brain out of everything & concentrate on the task/talk at hand.

When you feel like your being distracted, focus as much as you can on a pressent moment, observe whats going on around you. (Name 3 objects in the room)

`PeakAttention` : Think of the things you like doing, where your attention is at its peak. Remember this state and things that you can do to get to this state.

`Detached Thinking`: Stop identifiing with your thoughts. Observe your thoughts witout judging them
