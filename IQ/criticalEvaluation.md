The ability to 
- weigh alternatives, 
- evaluate contradictory evidence
- question assumptions
before making decisions is crucial to scholastic endeavors and adult life more generallyâ€”to personal happiness, professional success, and civic engagement.

While doing critical thinking you have to approach an idea with sceptism and doubt, rather than unquestioning acceptance. You are trying to identify unstated assumptions, biases, and points of views to show how they undermine the argument the author is making.

## Evidence based argument
> "Good critical thinking includes recognising good arguments even when we disagree with them, and poor arguments even when these support our own point of view."

#### Negativity
When you disagree based on poor argument, you are showing negativity and your biases. However when you put forward a good argument then your help in systematically advancing towards better solution. 

- Think not only the ideas for solving problems but also to provide reasons for the problem solving ideas that are advanced.
- Practice arguing for a point of view counter to their own
- Given some ill structured problem (cannot be solved logically) find multiple solutions and rank viability of each solution.

### Evaluating Arguments
- `biases`: Are different points of view considered fairly (not just of author)
- `strength`: Has the author failed to refer to another author whose argument could be used to support or undermine their argument
- `evidence`: Is there any relevant unbiased evidence to support the argument
- `emotional` : Does the argument use emotional appeal and personal opinion than force of reasoning

### Bad habits
- Avoiding arguments for egoistic reason
- Being in company of people who accept unquestioningly 
- Being a passive participant by not voicing out the concerns
- Being lazy in taking time for analyzing
