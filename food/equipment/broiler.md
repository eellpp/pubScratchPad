Broiler  
A broiler is an element in your oven – usually located near the top – that provides high, direct heat much like a grill. Broiling places food close to your oven’s heating element so that it can quickly cook, brown, char or caramelize. This can give food more complex flavors or help you achieve certain textures.

When you roast or bake food in your oven, the heating elements warm the air inside – cooking your food as it is surrounded by hot, dry air. In contrast, broiling exposes one side of your food to high, direct heat, making it ideal for cooking foods like you would on a grill.

Broiling also allows you to finish cooked foods by creating a crust on steaks, crisping bread, charring vegetables or melting and browning cheese toppings.
