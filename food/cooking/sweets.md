### Gajar halwa  
1. firstly, peel the skin of carrot and grate finely. keep aside
2. in a large kadai heat ¼ cup ghee and fry 10 cashew, 10 almonds.
3. fry until it turns golden brown. keep aside.
4. in the same ghee add grated carrot and saute well.
5. saute for 5 minutes or until it changes colour slightly.
6. now pour 3 cup milk and give a good stir.
7. boil for 10 minutes stirring occasionally.
8. continue to boil until the carrots are cooked well and milk reduces.
9. once the milk thickens completely, add ¾ cup sugar. Sugar will release more water from carrot and mix will appear wet. That is why before adding sugar ensure that carrot is well cooked. 
10. mix well and cook until the sugar dissolves and thickens. Carrot texture will change and become smooth
11. cook until the halwa thickens and ghee releases from sides.
12. now turn off the flame and ½ cup khoya (optional), ¼ tsp cardamom powder and fried nuts, saffron
13. mix well making sure everything is well combined.
