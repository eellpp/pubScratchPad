Vinegar is an alcoholic liquid that has been allowed to sour. It is primarily used to flavor and preserve foods and as an ingredient in salad dressings and marinades.

The transformation of wine or fruit juice to vinegar is a chemical process in which ethyl alcohol undergoes partial oxidation that results in the formation of acetaldehyde. In the third stage, the acetaldehyde is converted into acetic acid. 

sugar is turned into alcohol, which in turn is transformed into vinegar  
An example of this is to leave unpasteurized apple juice to ferment into cider, allowing the natural yeast to turn fruit sugars into alcohol, and then leave it even longer for the alcohol to ferment into acetic acid â€“ vinegar. This can take anything up to a year.
