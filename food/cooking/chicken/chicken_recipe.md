### Mustard bengali chicken curry
Wash and clean chicken pieces and pat dry with kitchen towels.  
Soak both mustard seeds (reserve ¼ tsp of each) and 5-7 chilis in ¼ cup warm water for 15 mins. and blend into smooth paste without additional water. Don’t grind more than three times as mustard seeds tend to get bitter in taste in case of over grinding.  
Add turmeric & chili powder with salt and 2 tbsp of mustard oil into the mustard paste and mix well.  
Marinate the chicken with this mustard mixture, cover and leave it to rest for 30 mins.  
Take a deep bottomed large pan and heat rest of the mustard oil. When the oil is smoking hot switch off the flame and add reserved mustard seeds and one slightly slitted green chili.  
Turn he flame on and add marinated chicken pieces one by one into the pan. Shake off the marinade from each chicken piece before adding to pan. Reserve the marinade that will be needed later.  
Fry chicken pieces on medium flame till chicken turn golden brown in colour from both sides. Flip chicken pieces couple of time for even cooking on both sides. It will take 8-10 mins.  
Once chicken is browned add reserved marinade to the pan and cook on high flame for 3-5 mins or until oil floats on top.  
Now add coconut milk over chicken and mix well. Once bubbles begin forming cover the pan and allow to cook for 10 mins on simmer.  
After 10 mins check if chicken is done; if not cook for another 5-7 mins. Add sugar and adjust seasoning at this point.  
Continue cooking on high flame until curry reaches to personal preference. I cook it further until oil floats back on top.  
Switch off the flame, add more green chilli, cover and keep on stand by for another 10 mins.  
Serve hot Shorshe Murgi with steamed rice. Enjoy!  

### Chicken for Cinnamon sticks, dried chillies, peppercorns, star anise and fennel seeds.
Toast the coconut in a pan over a low heat, stirring until it turns golden brown.  
Remove the coconut to a plate and into the same pan add the cinnamon sticks, dried chillies, peppercorns, star anise and fennel seeds. Roast in the pan for 3-4 minutes then add the ground coriander and chilli powder and stir for a minute. Add 100ml of water to form a paste and cook for 2 minutes.  
Remove the cinnamon sticks, star anise and whole chillies and keep for later. Add the toasted coconut, turmeric and salt to the pan. Add everything to a spice grinder or pestle and mortar and grind to a smooth paste.  
Heat the oil in the same pan and slowly cook the onions until they are soft – this will take about 10 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger and cook for a couple of minutes then turn up the heat and add the curry leaves and stir for a minute.  
Add the tomatoes and the spice paste, return the cinnamon stick, star anise and chillie to the pan and cook for 5 minutes, stirring until you end up with a smooth paste and the oil starts to separate out.  
Remove half the mixture and freeze or place in an airtight container which will keep in the fridge for a week or so.  
Add the chicken and cook, covered, for 10 minutes. Add 200ml chicken stock remove the lid and cook for a further 5-10 minutes until the chicken is cooked through.
