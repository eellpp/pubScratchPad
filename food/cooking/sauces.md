### Oyster Sauce
Oyster sauce is commonly used in stir-fries like our Beef Stir-Fry with Bell Peppers and Black Pepper Sauce. It is also a key ingredient in Kung Pao Shrimp, Spicy Sichuan Noodles, and other Asian-style dishes. The bottled sauce, also known as oyster-flavored sauce, is made from a reduction of boiled oysters. Savory with a hint of sweetness, it is a rich, concentrated mixture of the oyster extractives, brine, and assorted seasonings. 

### Hoisin Sauce
Made from soybeans, sugar, vinegar, garlic, and chiles, hoisin sauce packs a punch and adds spicy, salty, and sweet elements to stir-fries and meat dishes, such as Mu Shu Pork. It can also be used as a dipping sauce. We’ve found that no two brands are alike, though, and our tasters deemed the perfect hoisin sauce to be one with balanced flavor and smooth rather than grainy consistency, like our winner, Kikkoman Hoisin Sauce.
