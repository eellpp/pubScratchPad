### fenugreek  
fenugreek’s ideal flavor as one that starts out bitter but ends with a rolling, lingering sweetness. He promises that it adds depth to neutral main ingredients, like potatoes and lentils, and that it balances pungently spicy or earthy flavors, making it so common in curries. And that it’s a go-to for any dish needing a touch of bitter to balance out sweet or sour.  

For a barbecued fish marinade, combine crushed dried leaves with some mustard, yogurt, and fish paste, slather all over your whole fish, then grill or broil. For a play on butter chicken, blend fenugreek into a tomato gravy: “Fenugreek’s slight bitterness compliments it,”
