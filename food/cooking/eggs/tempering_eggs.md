What Does Tempered Eggs Mean?
Tempered Eggs is simply a process of slowly warming the eggs before introducing them to your recipe so they mix smoothly.

Example: If you have a hot pot of milk and stir in eggs, youâ€™ll end up with little scrambled egg bits in the milk instead of a smooth mixture.

If you add a little bit of the hot milk to the eggs while whisking, you will bring the temperature up slowly so they will mix smoothly into your milk.  

1) Bring the liquid to a boil (broth, stock, milk, or cream).
2) Whisk the eggs separately in another bowl. Using eggs whites or egg yolks will yield different results, but most tempered eggs use the entire egg.
3) Slowly add the hot liquid to the eggs a little bit at a time and whisk constantly. The key here is to slowly bring up the temperature of the eggs without cooking or scrambling them
