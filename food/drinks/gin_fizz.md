- 1 ounce fresh lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon sugar, preferably superfine
- 2 ounces London Dry-style gin
-  Club soda, to top
- Lemon wedge, for garnish

Fill a cocktail shaker with ice and add lemon juice, sugar and gin. Shake vigorously and strain into a highball glass. Top with club soda and garnish with a wedge of lemon.  

Adding an egg white would make this a Silver Fizz. Adding an egg yolk makes it a Golden Fizz. Ad adding a whole egg turns it into a Royal Fizz (which is delicious, btw).
