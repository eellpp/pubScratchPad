### Coco Colada Smoothie With Fresh Coconut and Pineapple
If you have the desire to make a really fresh Coco Colada, try this smoothie recipe!

You will need to find a young Thai coconut and open it using this tutorial. The surprise inside is fresh coconut water and the sweet, white flesh and both of these elements can be used to create a fresh drink for two.

To make this smoothie, blend the meat and water from 1 coconut with 2 cups fresh and cubed pineapple, 1 cup plain Greek yogurt, and 1/2 cup ice (use more if needed). Makes 2 drinks.

Note: If you do not have a fresh coconut, substitute about 2 ounces of coconut cream and add more if needed.
