And Anthony Bourdain has a nice related bit on how working clean reduces error and increases efficiency. From Kitchen Confidential:

Mise-en-place is the religion of all good line cooks. Do not fuck with a line cook’s ‘meez’ — meaning his setup, his carefully arranged supplies of sea salt, rough-cracked pepper, softened butter, cooking oil, wine, backups, and so on.

As a cook, your station, and its condition, its state of readiness, is an extension of your nervous system...

The universe is in order when your station is set up the way you like it: you know where to find everything with your eyes closed, everything you need during the course of the shift is at the ready at arm’s reach, your defenses are deployed.

If you let your mise-en-place run down, get dirty and disorganized, you’ll quickly find yourself spinning in place and calling for backup. I worked with a chef who used to step behind the line to a dirty cook’s station in the middle of a rush to explain why the offending cook was falling behind. He’d press his palm down on the cutting board, which was littered with peppercorns, spattered sauce, bits of parsley, bread crumbs and the usual flotsam and jetsam that accumulates quickly on a station if not constantly wiped away with a moist side towel. “You see this?” he’d inquire, raising his palm so that the cook could see the bits of dirt and scraps sticking to his chef’s palm. “That’s what the inside of your head looks like now.”

### Kitchen cleanup
On a good night I will be cleaning while I cook. I don’t want to serve dinner with a pile of every dish that I touched during prep piled dirty in the sink. In an ideal scenario, after the last course is placed on a serving dish, I have exactly two things left to clean; the pan that cooked that last thing, and the utensil used to transfer it.
On a truly good night, the kitchen ends up cleaner by the time dinner is cooked than when I started.

Often the first thing I do before cooking a meal is some cleanup.
