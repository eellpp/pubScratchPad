Heat a Pan and add 6 to 8 Dry Red Chillies.
0:28
Stir continuously and dry roast it.
0:31
Maintain a medium flame.
0:34
Adding 8 Dry Red Chillies will yield enough heat.
0:37
If you like it less spicy, reduce the number.
0:41
Dry roast till the Dry Red Chillies turn brown.
0:45
Maintain a medium flame.
0:48
Don't forget to stir continuously.
0:51
It's been about 5 - 6 minutes.
0:54
Dry Red Chillies have started to turn brown.
0:56
Turn off the flame and shift it from the pan immediately.
1:01
Into the same Pan, add 1 cup of cleaned Dried Shrimp.
1:06
Dry roast it while stirring continuously.
1:10
This Dry Shrimps are after removing head and tail,
1:12
washed and dried again.
1:16
You may not get it like this everywhere.
1:18
If there is head and tail, remove it and use.
1:22
Dry roast it well so that it can be easily crumbled with your hands.
1:27
Try to maintain a medium flame here as well.
1:31
It's been about 6 - 7 minutes now.
1:35
As you can see, it can be easily crumbled using your hands.
1:39
At this stage, turn off the flame and shift the contents from the Pan.
1:44
Into the same Pan, add 2 cups of Grated Coconut.
1:49
Add 1 inch piece of Ginger (Finely Chopped).
1:54
Add 5 Shallots (Sliced).
1:58

2:04
Shred the Tamarind into small pieces like this.
2:07
Set the flame in a low to medium level.
2:10
Roast the ingredients while stirring continuously.
2:15
Roast it till Grated Coconut turns golden in colour.
2:19
You need not roast it till it turns brown.
2:25
Turn off the flame as soon as it turns golden colour.
2:28

2:31
Don't forget to stir continuously.
2:34
It's roasted to the desired consistency.
2:36
Grated coconut has turned golden colour.
2:39
Immediately turn off the flame, or else it will burn.
2:42
Too much browning will alter the taste of the Chammanthi podi.
2:45
Into this, add Â¾ teaspoon of Salt.
2:48
Take care to measure and add Salt.
2:51
Also, add the dry roasted Dry Prawns and Dry Red Chillies.

Mix and combine the ingredients well.
3:00
Let it cool down completely before grinding it.
3:04
Shifting the contents into another pan speeds up the process of cooling down.
3:10
I've shifted the contents into a Mixer jar after cooling down.
3:13
Now, let's crush it.
3:15
Crush it gently and don't grind it into a fine paste.
3:21
Also give a quick stir in between.
3:30
Unakka Chemmeen Chammanthi Podi is ready here.
3:32
Let it cool down completely before,
3:35
storing it in a moisture - free, air - tight container.
