Erachi Choru is a traditional Kerala meat and rice dish, particularly popular in the Malabar region. 

**Ingredients:**

- **For the Meat Masala:**
  - 400g beef, cubed
  - 1¼ cups shallots, sliced
  - 1 tbsp crushed ginger
  - 1.5 tbsp crushed garlic
  - 1.5 small tomatoes, sliced
  - 6–8 green chilies, crushed
  - A tiny pinch of fenugreek seeds
  - ½ tsp turmeric powder
  - ½ tsp pepper powder
  - ½ tsp coriander powder
  - 1 tsp garam masala powder
  - 2 tbsp yogurt
  - 1 tbsp coconut oil
  - Salt, to taste
  - 1.5 tbsp each of chopped cilantro and mint leaves
  - 1 sprig curry leaves

- **For the Rice:**
  - 1 cup matta rice (Kerala red rice)
  - Whole spices: ½ tsp fennel seeds, 1 star anise, 4 cloves, ½-inch cinnamon stick, 4 green cardamom pods
  - ½ tsp turmeric powder
  - 1 cup thin coconut milk
  - 1 cup water
  - 1 tsp coconut oil
  - Salt, to taste

- **For Final Garnish:**
  - 2 tsp coconut oil
  - ½ tsp garam masala powder
  - 1 tbsp each of chopped mint and cilantro

**Method:**

1. **Prepare the Meat Masala:**
   - In a pressure cooker, combine all ingredients listed under meat masala. Mix well using your fingers.
   - Reserve ¼ cup of this mixture for cooking the rice.
   - Add the cubed beef to the remaining mixture in the cooker, along with 1 tbsp water.
   - Pressure cook for 4–5 whistles until the beef is tender. Allow the pressure to release naturally (about 15 minutes). Check seasoning and adjust salt if necessary.

2. **Cook the Rice:**
   - In a large pressure cooker, combine the rice with the reserved ¼ cup onion mixture, whole spices, turmeric powder, thin coconut milk, water, coconut oil, and salt.
   - Pressure cook for 2 whistles until the rice is about 90% cooked. Let the pressure release naturally (approximately 15 minutes).

3. **Combine and Finalize:**
   - Once the rice is partially cooked, gently mix in the cooked beef along with its gravy.
   - Taste and adjust salt as needed.
   - Cover and cook on the lowest heat setting for 5 minutes or until the rice and meat are fully cooked and flavors meld together. Alternatively, you can pressure cook for 1 whistle, depending on the type of rice used.
   - Turn off the heat and let it rest for 10 minutes.
   - Before serving, add 2 tsp coconut oil, ½ tsp garam masala powder, and chopped mint and cilantro. Mix gently.
   - Cover and let the dish rest for an additional 15 minutes to allow the flavors to develop fully.

**Serving Suggestion:**
Serve hot with pickle, pappadam, and raita for a complete meal.
