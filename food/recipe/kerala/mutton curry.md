Greetings.
0:10
We'll see how to prepare a delicious Mutton Curry.
0:17
In a pressure cooker, I've taken 1 kg of Mutton with bones.
0:24
Bones and fat increases the taste of the Mutton Curry.
0:28
Add ½ tablespoon of freshly ground Black Pepper.
0:32
That will be around 1½ teaspoon.
0:34
Add 1 tablespoon of Coriander Powder.
0:38
Add 1 teaspoon of Chilli Powder.
0:42
Add ½ teaspoon of Turmeric Powder.
0:45
Add 1 teaspoon of Garam Masala.
0:48
You may use 1½ teaspoon of Meat Masala instead of Garam Masala.
0:53
Add ½ tablespoon of Lime / Lemon Juice.
0:58
Add 1 teaspoon of Salt.
1:01
Mix and combine them well.
1:07
After mixing, add ½ cup of Water.
1:12
Close the lid and pressure cook to 3 - 4 whistles.
1:17
After cooking it on high flame to the first whistle,
1:19
set a low flame to subsequent whistles.
1:22
Turn off the flame after that and
1:24
let the pressure release for 15 - 20 minutes.
1:27
Kindly note that the number of whistles depends on
1:31
the Mutton available and the size and brand of the Pressure cooker.
1:35
We shall prepare the gravy by the time the Mutton is cooked.
1:40
Heat 4 tablespoon of Oil in a Pan or Kadai.
1:44
When the Oil is hot, set the flame to a medium level.
1:48
Add 200 gm (35 nos) of Shallots (Sliced).
1:54
Add 1 Onion (Sliced).
1:57
It will taste better if we add more Shallots instead of Onion.
2:02
Add 1½ inch long Ginger (Chopped).
2:06
Add 8 cloves of Garlic (Chopped).
2:10
Add 2 Green Chillies (Chopped).
2:14
Add 1 teaspoon of Salt.
2:16
Always try to add Salt using a measuring spoon.
2:19
Sauté it for 15 minutes till it turns golden colour.
2:25
Let the flame be on medium flame itself.
2:29
It has turned golden colour now.
2:32
Now, set the flame to a low level.
2:35
Add 2 tablespoon of Coriander Powder.
2:38
Add 1 teaspoon of Chilli Powder.
2:41
Add 1 teaspoon of Garam Masala.
2:45
Mix it for 30 seconds till the raw flavour subsides.
2:50
You may use 1½ teaspoon of Meat Masala instead of Garam Masala.
2:54
I've already done a video on how to prepare Homemade Garam Masala.
2:59
The link is provided in the description.
3:01
Quickly, add 1 Tomato (Finely Chopped).
3:07
Adding Tomato is an optional step.
3:10
Add 3 sprigs of Curry Leaves.
3:13
If you like the flavour, add ¼ cup of Coriander Leaves.
3:19
Here, adding Coriander Leaves and Tomatoes are purely optional.
3:24
Mix and combine well for 1 minute.
3:27
Maintain a low flame throughout.
3:31
Now, add 1 cup of Hot Water.
3:35
Increase the flame and mix and combine well.
3:39
When it starts to boil,
3:41
add the pressure cooked Mutton into it.
3:45
Pressure cooked Mutton is done well.
3:48
We shall add it to the gravy.
3:52
Mix and combine them well.
3:56
When it starts to boil,
3:59
close the lid and cook for 10 more minutes.
4:02
The flame should be on a medium level.
4:05
After 10 minutes, remove the lid and
4:08
Add ½ tablespoon of freshly ground Black Pepper.
4:12
Mix and combine them well.
4:16
Now, turn off the flame.
4:19
Let it sit for 15 minutes so that the flavours balance well,
4:22
and then serve it.
4:24
It serves 6, when we use 1 kg of Mutton.
4:28
Be it Appam, Puttu, Chappathi, Parotta or Rice,
