Take your sliced eggplant and lay the rounds out on a rack and sprinkle them with salt.  Repeat the process on the other side as well.  Let the eggplant sweat for about 20 to 30 minutes.  This will help to pull out some moisture in the eggplant so that they will crisp up easier.  

After 30 min. rinse the eggplant under running water to remove the salt.  Pat the eggplant dry with paper towels.  
 
Preheat your oven to 400 degrees F and coat your baking pan with a light coating of olive oil.  

In a wide bowl, combine the panko crumbs, flour, and all the Italian seasonings.  Whisk the eggs in a separate bowl.  

Dip a slice of eggplant into the egg mixture and then into the panko crumb mixture to coat on all sides.  Then place the slice onto your prepared baking sheet.  Continue doing this until the pan is full.  Be sure not to crowd the pieces so they can brown up properly.  

Shave paper thin slices of butter on top of each piece of eggplant.  Place in the oven for about 30 minutes or until golden brown.  Turn the slices over half way through the cooking time.
