### Does cooking wine remove alcohol

A study from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Nutrient Data lab confirmed this and added that food baked or simmered in alcohol for 15 minutes still retains 40 percent of the alcohol. After an hour of cooking, 25 percent of the alcohol remains, and even after two and a half hours there's still 5 percent of it.

How to Add Wine to the Dishes to Make Them Safe For Kids?  
The most crucial thing about cooking with wine is to ensure that it will evaporate completely if you decided to let your children taste that dish. To achieve that, follow the easy suggestions:  
Remember that wine needs pretty much time to be removed from the food so the sauce or other mixture where the drink was added to must be simmered (or baked depending on the recipe) for at least one hour.  
Stronger beverages (for instance, rum or cognac that are often added to the various sweet bakery) might need more than sixty minutes for the alcohol to evaporate.  
Go for a wide and uncovered pan for cooking such foods since such a tank provides a larger surface area which makes it simpler for the alcohol to evaporate upwards.  


### Substitutes for wine
Red wine vinegar is best used with beef, pork and vegetables, while white wine vinegar works well in less hearty dishes, such as those with chicken and fish.  

Wine vinegar is more acidic than regular wine, so it is recommended to dilute it before adding it to recipes, for instance by mixing water and wine vinegar at a 1:1 ratio.  
It is important to note that vinegar may contain trace amounts of alcohol, although it mostly disappears during the fermentation process. The alcohol content is also reduced with cooking.  
However, if alcohol is restricted from your diet, you may prefer to avoid wine vinegars.

Use These Substitutes for Red Wine  
1. Red wine vinegar: The acidity in vinegar makes it a good substitute for deglazing the pan.
2. Grape, pomegranate, or cranberry juice: These rich-flavored juices are also acidic which makes them a good substitute for deglazing a pan. Their deep fruit and berry flavors will also add depth of flavor to a recipe. For a punchier substitute, try mixing a tablespoon of vinegar per cup of juice.
3. Chicken, beef, or vegetable stock: Even though it’s less acidic, and more mild in flavor than red wine, stock is an ideal candidate for adding flavor to a dish. For extra flavor, try mixing a tablespoon of vinegar per cup of stock.

Use These Substitutes for White Wine
1. White wine vinegar: This is an ideal substitute for dry white wine, especially when its purpose is to deglaze a pan. Made from white wine, white wine vinegar has many of the same flavor characteristics, minus the alcohol.
2. Lemon juice: This is another good substitute for deglazing. Fresh lemon juice is a good way to replicate the tangy flavor white wine brings to a dish. Dilute the lemon juice with an equal amount of water to prevent it from being too overpowering.
3. White grape juice: Use white grape juice as a substitute when you want to add sweetness, or deglaze the pan. For a punchier substitute, try mixing a tablespoon of vinegar or lemon juice per cup of grape juice.
4. Chicken or vegetable stock: Substitute stock for white wine when you want to add depth of flavor to a dish. For extra flavor, try mixing a tablespoon of vinegar or lemon juice per cup of stock.
