### Curd Sandwich
grated carrots (or tomtaoes,cabbage,lettuce  )
pepper  
chilli flakes  
butter  
fresh herbs  
mustard  

Mis all ingredients in a bowl and spread over grilled/toasted bread.  

### Mayo Sandwich 
1. Mince 1 garlic clove, chop 1 green chili and ¼ of a medium onion (2 tablespoons fine chopped). Add all of these to a mixing bowl. Squeeze 1 tablespoon lemon juice & mix well. Lemon juice removes the pungent smell from garlic and onions. However if your mayo is too sour then skip the lemon juice.  
2. Prepare the other veggies of your choice and add them to the bowl. I have used ¼ cup butter lettuce and ¼ cup chopped red capsicum here. You can also use shredded cabbage, carrots, boiled sweet corn etc. You can use about ½ cup in total.  
3. Add ¼ teaspoon crushed black pepper, ¼ to ½ teaspoon red chili flakes, ¼ cup mayo (about 4 tablespoons) and ¼ teaspoon mustard powder. If you do not have mustard you can skip it, but I feel it adds lot of aroma to the filling. Mix all the ingredients. The filling is ready. Taste test and add more of chilli, pepper or mayo etc.You may add any other sauce like red chilli sauce, mustard sauce or schezwan sauce.    

 if you do not have any kind of mayo then simply strain your homemade yogurt in a cheese cloth or muslin cloth and use it in the recipe. For more details you may check this recipe of hung curd. The other substitutes for mayo are cream cheese & Greek yogurt.

### Egg Mayo Sandwich
