Braising is actually a combination of cooking techniques whereby you lightly fry your meat before letting it cook, or “stew” in some kind of liquid (generally wine), in a covered dish until fully cooked

#### French chicken chasseur
The chicken chasseur is a classic French stew made with pieces of chicken, which are braised in brown chicken stock, tomato sauce, mushrooms, shallots, tarragon and parsley. It is best made using a cast iron dutch oven. Serve with a side of potatoes or a good quality tagliatelle.
