1. Wash the spinach well under running water and let it dry thoroughly. (Note : Dry the leaves completely before cutting). Chop the spinach finely.
2. Grind coconut, green chillies, turmeric powder and cumin into a coarse paste.
3. Combine the chopped spinach with some salt and keep aside.
4. Heat the oil in pan and splutter mustard seeds, followed by rice, add sliced shallots, crushed garlic, dry red chillies, curry leaves and saute for a few minutes.
5. Add the chopped spinach and mix everything and reduce the fire to medium, keep covered for a minute to wilt the spinach.(Note : Don’t cover for long, since the steam will accumulate ,which in turn end up in lumps).
6. Spread out the spinach to the side of the pan and make a well in the middle,add the coconut mixture and combine everything together.
7. Uncover the pan and cook on low flame for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally till all the water evaporates, adjust the salt.
8. Stir fry carefully for another 2-3 minutes so that all water evaporates and the spinach is not soggy…Serve with rice & Enjoy
