Light travels in peaks and troughs. And the distance between each trough is called a wavelength. Different colours of light have waves of different lengths. Red light has a long wavelength (about 700 nanometres), violet light has a short wavelength (about 400 nanometres), and the rest of the spectrum is spread out in between.



We see something as a particular colour when light of that colour hits our eyes –either directly from a light source or reflected from a surface

Blue light has a short wavelength (about 475 nanometres), and is scattered or deflected much more easily than red light. Because it’s easily scattered it doesn’t penetrate so far into the skin (only a fraction of a millimetre). When blue light hits the skin, it’s mostly deflected back.

If you shine a blue light on your skin, what you see is basically blue skin, and veins are hard to find. You may have seen blue light used in spaces such as public bathrooms to discourage intravenous drug use.  

Red light has a long wavelength – and this means it is less likely to be deflected by materials and can more easily travel through. Red light can travel pretty well through the skin and body tissues, reaching up to 5-10mm below the skin, which is where many veins are.

When it gets to the veins, the red light is absorbed by the haemoglobin (the protein that makes our blood red). You can demonstrate this to yourself. If you shine a red light on your arm, you will see some red light reflected back, and dark lines where the veins are, as the red light is absorbed by the haemoglobin.


### Why sky is blue
As the white light from the Sun enters Earth’s atmosphere, much of the red, yellow, and green wavelengths of light (mixed together and still nearly white) pass straight through the atmosphere to our eyes. The blue and violet waves, however, are just the right size to hit and bounce off of the molecules of gas in the atmosphere. This causes the blue and violet waves to be separated from the rest of the light and become scattered in every direction for all to see. The other wavelengths stick together as a group, and therefore remain white.  


**At day horizon is light blue or white**  
Closer to the horizon, the sky fades to a lighter blue or white. The sunlight reaching us from the horizon has passed through even more air than the sunlight reaching us from overhead. The molecules of gas have rescattered the blue light in so many directions so many times that less blue light reaches us.  

**At sunset sky is red**
As the Sun gets lower in the sky, its light passes through more of the atmosphere to reach you. Even more of the blue and violet light is scattered, allowing the reds and yellows to pass straight through to your eyes without all that competition from the blues.

Also, larger particles of dust, pollution, and water vapor in the atmosphere reflect and scatter more of the reds and yellows, sometimes making the whole western sky glow red.
