### How to figure out how far away the accretion disk is from the black hole
You can estimate how close to the event horizon the disk is based on how broad the spectral lines are. The part of the disk that is coming towards you will be blueshifted and the part of the disk that is rotating away will be redshifted. From that (which is independent of the overall depth of the potential well) you can figure out how fast the disk is rotating. And from that you can figure out how far away the disk is from the black hole.

### How astronomers determine a galaxy’s distance based on the light emitted by it
The infrared light collected from distant galaxy is reddened, or redshifted, meaning that as it traverses the cosmos, its wavelengths are stretched by the expansion of space. The extent of that redshift lets astronomers determine a galaxy’s distance, and therefore when it originally emitted its light.
