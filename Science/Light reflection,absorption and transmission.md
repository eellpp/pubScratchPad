## Light Reflection, absorption and transmission

Why leaf is green. Why glass is transparent and mirror is reflective.

Light is part of electromagnetic spectrum. Electromagnetic spectrum is the Electric and magnetic field fluctuation that transmit energy from one point to another. It can also be thought as travelling in fixed packets called photons (Wave Particle duality). Electro magnetic fluctuations are at different frequencies like radio waves/ microwaves and light etc. 

### What is seeing
The first living creatures did not have any eyes. As they evolved in sea, the ones who could sense day from night had advantages as they could avoid the ultraviolet burst during the day time near the surface of the sea. Then they further evolved into better forms of seeing. Even now the way the eyes see in water born animals is different from seeing in air on the land. Our seeing the reflected light from everywhere hitting our eyes where it converts into electrical signals and is send to the brain. The actual seeing happens in the brain where these electrical signals are processed. Our seeing is of no special significance to the universe. It is the ability developed by the species to survive among all other competing species. We see only a narrow spectrum of electromagnetic spectrum called visible light. Their are many others like X Rays, gamma rays etc which we don't see , since they didn't provide any natural advantages.

### Light Absorption
Light have different frequencies of photon. Free electrons in atoms of elements have specific vibration frequency. When photon of the matching frequency strikes the atom, the electrons vibrate in higher amplitude due to resonance. This cause heat energy and this heat is absorbed into the material. This material is totally dark.  
- A leaf aborbs blue and red spectrum of light and reflects back the green. 
- pure coal aborbs all spectrum of light and appears black
- diamond has all the free electrons bound to other carbon molecule. They are not free to vibrate  and just pass on the vibration of photon. The light just passes through the element. Thus diamond is transparent.


### Light Reflection
When light of certain freq its the atom, then it does not resonate with the natural freq of the electron in the atom, then in this case it just passes it back the medium it came from. This is reflection

### Transmission
When the light hits the atom of silica (having similar 4 free electron like carbon), then instead of absorbing or reflecting , the electrons just pass the vibration to next atom and then finally to the medium behind. This the light passes through the medium and and we can see through the material.
