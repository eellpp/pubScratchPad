## Charge
An object is called charged negative when it has extra electrons and positive if it has not enough electron.
If the surface of an object is charged, then that charge produces electric field around it. This is again the nature of charge. Charge makes others aware of its existence there, by its field around itself.


## What happens when we charge surfaces by rubbing them
The rubbing of certain materials against one another can transfer negative charges, or electrons. For example, if you rub your shoe on the carpet, your body collects extra electrons. The electrons cling to your body until they can be released. As you reach and touch your furry friend, you get a shock. Don't worry, it is only the surplus electrons being released from you to your unsuspecting pet.

And what about that "hair raising" experience? As you remove your hat, electrons are transferred from hat to hair, creating that interesting hairdo! Remember, objects with the same charge repel each other. Because they have the same charge, your hair will stand on end. Your hairs are simply trying to get as far away from each other as possible!

If you rub plastic comb against dry hair, electrons are removed from comb and added to dry hair.
Why the electron transfer happens is much deeper question that requires quantum physics understanding.

### Why neutrinos can pass through everything

If space was filled with water, the neutrinos will pass 100 light years of it without any interaction. Similarly with iron or other heavy metals. The neutrinos from sun, just pass through the earth. 

Neutrinos are massless and so feel no gravity force. They are neutral in charge so don't interact in the electromagnetic force.
