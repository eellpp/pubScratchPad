Once winter ends and temperatures rise, higher levels of testosterone drive male king cobras to forgo eating altogether to focus their energies on sex. The female’s coquettish behaviour and the male’s lack of appetite for food must protect these predators from each other.


In April 2008, villagers called the Agumbe Rainforest Research Station, Karnataka, to report that a pair of king cobras had taken up residence in their backyard. For four weeks, field assistants observed the pair emerge from a burrow every morning, bask, and retire inside by midday. Sometimes, the snakes mated in full view of their audience. Their devotion to each other was touching, since most other species go their separate ways soon after mating.

Then another 11-foot male king cobra showed up, and the two evenly sized males fought, twining their bodies while pushing and jostling with their heads and necks. During the ritualised wrestling, neither snake bit the other. The one that repeatedly slammed the other’s head down appeared to be the victor, and the defeated snake crawled away. Since the snakes were identical, no one could tell the newcomer from the steady partner.

The winner jabbed the coils of the nine-foot-long female in the snake version of foreplay, and she reciprocated with a sinuous feminine display. Despite a supposed lack of hunger and recognising the female by sight and scent, what the male did next shocked the observers.

He grabbed her by the throat, his enormous mouth choking her windpipe and pumping in venom. Her desperate struggles against his bulldog grip ripped her throat and blood spurted on the ground. She took a long time to die. When her body went completely limp, he started swallowing her. He worked his way down two-thirds of her body until he came to her belly bulging with eggs. Then inexplicably, he threw up and crawled away from the lifeless body.

The video made by the field assistants makes for tough viewing. Disturbed and appalled, my earlier affection for the species evaporated.

Researchers struggled to explain why the male killed the female. Although there’s no scientific proof, the field assistants thought the intruder was the victorious male. That surmise makes some sense of an unfathomable incident. Perhaps by April, when the mating season was almost over, the urgency to find a meal after the month or two of starvation was more powerful than the desire to mate. But hunger didn’t explain why the male threw up his meal and abandoned it. Or why he didn’t swallow the defeated male. Could this episode have been an aberration?


King cobras take anomalous behaviour to an extreme. While the females are the only snakes to build a nest, the males appear to be the only ones to deliberately hunt down egg-laden females.

I asked Graham Alexander, of the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa, and one of the researchers of the African cobra study, if he could explain what was going on with king cobras. “I think that it may be in the interests of a male to eat a female if there is little chance of him breeding with her,” he replied. “So, this could be because she is gravid or is unwilling to mate. In such a case, the male has little to lose and lots to gain by eating her.” He also suggests that cannibalism could possibly control the density of the population. “There is some special behaviour going on with king cobras. It’s all pretty interesting, but we do need more data.”
