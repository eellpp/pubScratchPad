#### Difference between DNA and Gene
A gene is is a section of DNA that is capable of transcribing to an RNA which is further translated to form protein. Gene is a specific section of DNA that is responsible for doing something like hair color  
DNA are packaged into chromosomes. Chromosomes comes in pairs of 2. One chromosome from dad and another from mom.  

### DNA and RNA
DNA stays inside the nucleus. RNA can move out into the cytoplasm.   
mRNA is messenger RNA that carries the message from DNA with instruction to make protein.  
Other types of RNA are tRNA and rRNA  


#### Chromosomes
In the nucleus of each cell, the DNA molecule is packaged into thread-like structures called chromosomes. Each chromosome is made up of DNA tightly coiled many times around proteins that support its structure.

The chromosome is a single double-stranded double helix, made of `two DNA molecules` hydrogen-bonded to each other. We are diploid, and we have 23 pairs of chromosomes, for a total of 46 chromosomes. 

In humans, each cell normally contains 23 pairs of chromosomes, for a total of 46. Twenty-two of these pairs, called autosomes, look the same in both males and females. The 23rd pair, the sex chromosomes, differ between males and females. Females have two copies of the X chromosome, while males have one X and one Y chromosome.

- A chromosome is made of 2 DNA molecule
- A chromosome id double stranded double helix
- Human cell has 23 chromosome (and 46 when replicating)

Analogy to chromosomes and DNA base pair is like a multi part book and words in those books.
-  A 1-book story, like The Hobbit. (E. coli bacteria is a single cell organism that contains only one chromosome. This one chromosome contains 5,000 protein-coding genes,)
- But for others, it is split into several books (chromosomes), like The Lord of the Rings, which is split into 3 books (3 chromosomes).
- for humans its split into 23 books

#### What is a gene?
Genes are fragments or strands into which the DNA is divided.

The human genome has around 25,000 to 30,000 genes. So that’s around 25,000 to 30,000 genes distributed in 23 chromosome pair.

The Human Genome Project has estimated that humans have between 20,000 and 25,000 genes.

Every person has two copies of each gene, one inherited from each parent. Most genes are the same in all people, but a small number of genes (less than 1 percent of the total) are slightly different between people. These small differences contribute to each person’s unique physical features.

#### What is DNA?
DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the hereditary material in humans and almost all other organisms. Nearly every cell in a person’s body has the same DNA. Most DNA is located in the cell nucleus (where it is called nuclear DNA), but a small amount of DNA can also be found in the mitochondria (where it is called mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA).

The information in DNA is stored as a code made up of four chemical bases: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). Human DNA consists of about 6 billion bases, and more than 99 percent of those bases are the same in all people. The order, or sequence, of these bases determines the information available for building and maintaining an organism, similar to the way in which letters of the alphabet appear in a certain order to form words and sentences.

The human genome contains approximately 3 billion of base pairs, which reside in the 23 pairs of chromosomes within the nucleus of all our cells. Each chromosome contains hundreds to thousands of genes, which carry the instructions for making proteins.

That makes a total of 6 billion base pairs of DNA per cell.

DNA bases pair up with each other, A with T and C with G, to form units called base pairs. Each base is also attached to a sugar molecule and a phosphate molecule. Together, a base, sugar, and phosphate are called a nucleotide. Nucleotides are arranged in two long strands that form a spiral called a double helix. The structure of the double helix is somewhat like a ladder, with the base pairs forming the ladder’s rungs and the sugar and phosphate molecules forming the vertical sidepieces of the ladder.


An important property of DNA is that it can replicate, or make copies of itself. Each strand of DNA in the double helix can serve as a pattern for duplicating the sequence of bases. This is critical when cells divide because each new cell needs to have an exact copy of the DNA present in the old cell.

### What is genome
 A genome is an organism's complete set of DNA, including all of its genes. Each genome contains all of the information needed to build and maintain that organism. In humans, a copy of the entire genome—more than 3 billion DNA base pairs—is contained in all cells that have a nucleus

### Does all cells in body have same DNA
Yes. But new research is showing that due to mutation there might be cells with different DNA

### How long is DNA
The DNA in your cells is packaged into 46 chromosomes in the nucleus. As well as being a naturally helical molecule, DNA is supercoiled using enzymes so that it takes up less space.

Try holding a piece of string at one end, and twisting the other. As you add twist, the string creates coils of coils; and eventually, coils of coils of coils. Your DNA is arranged as a coil of coils of coils of coils of coils! This allows the 3 billion base pairs in each cell to fit into a space just 6 microns across.

If you stretched the DNA in one cell all the way out, it would be about 2m long and all the DNA in all your cells put together would be about twice the diameter of the Solar System.

### DNA Similarity between species and humans
Here's some other common animals and our genetic similarites (these numbers are consistent across all reliable sources):

- Cat: 90%
- Cow: 80%
- Mouse: 75%
- Fruit Fly: 60%
- Banana: 50%

 What I find most fascinating is the 50% match to bananas! Animal and plant life share so much ancient DNA coding from way back when plant and animal life diverged approximately 1.5 billion years ago.
