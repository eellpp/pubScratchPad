Body cells make proteins.  

Proteins are the building blocks of our body. 

Genes are sections of DNA that contains code for making specific type of protein. 

### Transcription
In this process the information from the DNA is transcibed into a message.  
An enzyme called RNA polymerase connects RNA bases to DNA gene to form mRNA (messenger RNA). Messenger RNA can transfer out of the nucleus.   

mRNA travel out of the nucleus to go to Ribosome. The Ribosome make proteins. Ribosome itself is made of rRNA (ribosome RNA).

### Translation
The process by which Ribosome makes protein is called translation.  

Proteins are made of amino acids. tRNA is translation RNA that are floating in cytoplasm and each of them carry a specific amino acid. Ribosome uses the tRNA to get aminoacids to make protein.
