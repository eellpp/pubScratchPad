Any regular pattern you see in nature probably has something to do with an eigenvalue problem.
- Where does it get those 16-meter tides you can read about in the Guinness Book of Records? Well, the turning of the earth against the moon provides a gravitational tap every 12 hours and 25 minutes, like pushing a child on a swing, and a natural mode of oscillation of the bay has a period of about 13 hours. So the giant tides come from resonance fed by pumping at a frequency near an eigenvalue. 
- Musical instruments are built upon eigenvalues. The air in a flute vibrates according to the wave equation with atmospheric pressure at each end, so you get sine waves of pressure at approximately linearly spaced eigenfrequencies.
- A childs swing is an eigen value problem. There is a natural place in oscillation where application of force will make the swing go higher.The place corresponds to the eigen value of the dynamical system. All dynamical systems have eigen values.
- Radio tuning circuit to listen on a frequency is eigen value problem

The Swinging bridge: If there is natural freq of oscillation of the bridge and the wind blowing to matching freq such that as a child pushing the swing at the exact moment of swing so as to increase its amplitude.

Eigen values have a role in Fibonacci series and markov process.

du/dt = au ; has solution => u(t)= e^(at)u(0)
If a is complex; then a = x + yi then the rate of growth of u is governed by the real part x => e^xt 
The complex part is just oscillating since e^(yit) = sin(yt) + i cos(yt)
