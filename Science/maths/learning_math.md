### Book: A Mathematican's Lament by Paul Lockhart
https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf  

 I made an acquaintance with a retired math professor.   We had some long discussions about education.  He had stated he kept his kids out of school as long as he could.  It was his view that much of the structure of the public education taught your child not to think.  His son eventually went on to get a PHD in theoretical physics if is any reflection on his methods.

The book itself is more focused on math, but the general idea not quite different from education in general:
"So how do we teach our students to do mathematics? By choosing engaging and natural problems suitable to their tastes, personalities, and levels of experience. By giving them time to make discoveries and formulate conjectures. By helping them to refine their arguments and creating an atmosphere of healthy and vibrant mathematical criticism. By being flexible and open to sudden changes in the direction to which their curiosity may lead. In short, by having an honest intellectual relationship with our students and our subject."
