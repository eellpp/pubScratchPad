In contrast you cannot approach Soviet text math book without serious thinking effort. You need to overcome some mental barrier to get into. If you cannot do that then this is not yours - choose something else.  

Many US high school (and even undergraduate) textbooks are more or less analogous to taking a look-out-from-the-bus tour of rock climbing sites, or maybe like teaching an advanced wood shop class by making students assemble IKEA furniture.Textbooks should be exciting and fun, but “as easy as possible” is a terrible goal.  


In publicly funded systems students cost money, so there's an incentive to control cost. In privately-funded systems, students make money (in particular with universal loans), so everyone's a paying customer and nobody turns those away. Germany has roughly half the university graduation rate compared to the US, and this is the same reason why the US gives you 8 late-stage cancer treatments and the NHS gives you 2, or why sometimes you don't get the super expensive medicine you want.  

I think the point is that Russia's programs isolated those who had a talent/passion for math as opposed to just trying to bring every student to a basic level of understanding. If a student doesn't have the drive/talent/passion for a field, it follows that they will not perform as well in the workforce as their driven/talented/enthusiastic peers.  

They make the student work (participate actively in your own education), which I’ve noticed that American textbooks (at least modern high school & college textbooks) seem loath to do. I don’t know why — you don’t develop what you don’t exercise!  

### Tentative understanding to real understanding
In my experience, it's easy to think one has understanding without actually understanding. The process of applying that tentative understanding to a problem to test it is essential to figuring out what the flaws are in the tentative understanding so that real understanding can eventually be achieved. Once it gets to the point that a person can crank through problems without significant errors, then I think further problems don't do much good except as an occasional refresher.

it's interesting that some academic approaches focus on the theoretical framework and conceptual depth, with the underlying assumption that the student would "get" it once the fundamentals are understood.The other approach, mostly in the asian schools, teach rote and speed in mechanical/mental manipulation. For example, a student would do 1000 quadratic equations, mostly by rote using substitution into the formula. That constitutes "teaching" of the quadratic equation. But in the end, who learned more?  

### Rote Learning
Math is like basketball. You won't get good by watching people play. And you won't get good if you're just doing drills, you need to actually play. And playing in math means coming up with your own problems, trying different things, asking your own questions.  

however do remember that when you're learning to play basketball, or indeed any sport/musical instrument etc, you will spend a significant amount of time doing drills to improve your technical skill, fitness and so on.  

When you are confident with the "foundational skills", try to ask yourself why an argument works - approach the maths really critically. If you get stuck on your own, do some googling and try your best to understand, but don't be disheartened if you can't even with significant effort - there is a reason we teach maths in a certain order, and leave out rather a lot of the "why" until university/graduate/postgrad level study - it's hard!  

A fairly simple way to build deeper understanding is to look in your textbook for problems that have the word "prove," "show," or "why" in them. Do as many of these problems as you can.

### Why rote learning Drills
In my experience, those rote mental muscles mean that the basics are never slowing you down when tackling a harder problem. It's comparable to having a perfectly organized toolbox vs a mess of tools in your shed - you can do the same things, but you're free to focus on the core of the current task instead of distractions in the trivial parts.  

The first step in mastering a topic is rote learning of the basics so that your are up to speed when deeper deeper understanding is required. Basics should not slow you down.Reducing the friction between your brain and your tools simply makes you more effective.  

Eg: when reading sheet music or thinking in music, if theory is in your muscle memory, your entire conscious mind can focus on the actual, creative task at hand.
