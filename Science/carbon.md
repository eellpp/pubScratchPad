## Why Carbon is special

Carbon has six protons and neutrons. It has six electrons. Two of the electrons are in inner orbit and four are in the outer orbit and are free to form bonds with other atoms.

- able to form covalent (shared electron) bonds.
Silicon (Si), another element in group 14 of the periodic table, also has four valence electrons and can make large molecules called silicones, but its atoms are too large to fit together into as great a variety of molecules as carbon atoms can.

- able to share not only one electron but rather two or three bonds. 
This makes for a huge number of possible bond combinations at different places, making a huge number of different possible molecules. And a molecule that differs by even one atom or one bond position is a molecule of a different compound.

- able to form long chains
- others form two dimensional sheets of bonds. Carbon bonds can form three dimensional bonds by its four free valence electrons. 
- Forming organic compounds
All of the electrons that are not being used to bond carbon atoms together into chains and rings can be used to form bonds with atoms of several other elements. The most common other element is hydrogen, which makes the family of compounds known as hydrocarbons. But nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, halogens, and several other kinds of atoms can also be attached as part of an organic molecule. There is a huge number of ways in which they can be attached to the carbon-atom branches, and each variation makes a molecule of a different compound. It's just as if moving a Christmas tree ornament from one branch to another created a completely different tree.
