Acclaimed one-line drawing art, also known as continuous line drawing, emphasizes simplicity, minimalism, and flow. Here are some famous examples and styles:

1. **Pablo Picasso's One-Line Drawings**: Picasso is one of the most famous artists who used the one-line technique to create expressive portraits and animals. His minimalist portraits, where each is drawn with a single, unbroken line, are iconic.

2. **Henri Matisse's Line Art**: Matisse created beautiful, flowing figures and forms with simple, continuous lines. His drawings focused on the human body, especially dancers and nudes.

3. **David Hockney's iPad Drawings**: Hockney has embraced digital one-line drawings, creating works that blend traditional technique with modern technology.

4. **Quibe**: A contemporary artist known for one-line portraits and minimalist designs, Quibe creates evocative, elegant representations of faces and figures with continuous lines.

5. **Christoph Niemann**: Niemann uses one-line drawings in humorous and clever ways, often integrating them into illustrations that play with perspective and interpretation.

These styles demonstrate how simplicity and minimalism can convey deep emotion, expression, and beauty.

Prompt:  

“Create a continuous one-line drawing, in style of Quibe Art, of a man sitting at a desk in a relaxed, home environment, focused on his computer. The man’s posture should reflect concentration, with one hand typing on the keyboard and the other possibly resting on the desk or his chin, showing a casual working position. The background should hint at a home setting with simple lines suggesting a chair, desk, and perhaps a window or plant. Keep the lines smooth and uninterrupted, capturing the essence of work-from-home life with minimal but expressive strokes.”
