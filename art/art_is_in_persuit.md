The unreasonableness and impatience of ignorant persons, in expecting large results from small and brief exertions,have been most mischievous to those who have had to do with Art, whether as teachers or as students. A would-be amateur applies to a teacher for a few lessons,to enable him ' just to dash off a few telling effects from nature with his brush. He has never drawn much, and does not care for the pencil; all he wants is justto be able to paint effectively and quickly.'Now, in such a case as this, one of two things is certain " either that our would-be amateur must be wonderfully gifted,or that the teacher must be uncommonly stupid to have taken so many years to acquire that which is to be learned in a few lessons.  

*In all true artistic feeling,the pursuit, not the result, is the reward ; for where Art is rightly pursued,it produces a continual satisfaction in the fact that,however slow, there is progress, and that progress is sure ; and although the work done may have no mercantile value whatever, it may be regarded as the effort of an immortal mind striving to improve itself,and, therefore, precious.*


After going through such a course as is here sketched out, the student will find that his eye and hand have been brought under strict discipline,his perceptions quickened,his feelings made sensitive,and his whole being brought into sympathy with truth and beauty in Nature and in Art. He is thus prepared to enter with confidence of success into any technical application of drawing, or is able **to develop his faculties for still higher enjoyments in
that outward manifestation of God which we call Nature.**
