effective exercises designed to develop sensitivity to spacing, proportion and pattern – Composition, by Arthur Wesley Dow.

The Dow book exemplifies the concept of  drill. Each exercise isolates a specific area of composition and 
places emphasis on practising repeatedly to develop skill at it. The exercises are simplified. For months on end, 
I did nothing but simple line drawings of plants, and then took crops of those drawings and repeatedly refined them by tracing.
I’ve done literally hundreds of these simple little drawings. I credit this practice with developing my sensitivity to spacing and proportion.

I also did some practice with line quality and value design (which Dow calls notan). 
One way I did this was by redrawing the same simple picture of a lily 100 times, in two values.
