### 5 Tips
1. Use gesso
2. Put a ground color on the painting before the gesso dries (to help you get a sense of color vs. pure white)
3. Spray water on the opposite side to keep paint from coming through and evaporating
4. Use two different containers of water. One for washing your brush, one for thinning down your paint. Don't use too much water, just slightly dip then rub it on the rim of the lid afterwards, that'll be enough. 
5. Wet your palette to stop evaporatio
