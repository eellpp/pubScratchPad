If you are one who    
- does not give up. Will persue things till the very end. Its not over until you are over.   
- has a high pain threshold to withstand every kind of physical,social,emotional,financial setback  
Then you can start a business.  
Its painful,fun and enlightining all at same time. Just like raising a baby. 

Ever heard some successful guy saying, he failed 3 times and but was just lucky the fourth else his business would be dead.  
What he is hiding is the fact that he would have never given up. Not the 3'rd time and not the 200'th time.  
Its just the nature of beast. It seeks to fight. It revels in it. And this is what energizes it.  
Its not the success, but the challenge in seeking the next greater goal, after the success is what drives them.  
Are you like that. Does this feel exciting or terrible. Honestly ask yourself these questions.  



### The box model
Imagine your product is getting sold in a box.
- The front side of the box is customer facing and you can highlight only 2 or 3 key things in bold. What are those. They are your primary MVP features and should get most attention irrespective of how boring or non-challenging they are  
- At the backside, you have 3 or 4 points more in smaller fonts. These are you next set of features in priority  
- The sides have some additional stuff in smaller fonts. These are least important features  


### Small Lifestyle business
"Take a competitor product, remove all features you don’t need, and make it crazy fast."  
Seems to me there are hundreds of lifestyle businesses just waiting to happen by following this formula. So many good ideas out there could be made so much better by reducing them to their essentials, but making them elegant and "crazy fast".  
Incumbents over-serve their customers by adding lots of features, complexity, and cost. Upstarts can attack them by focusing on only a few core features and/or low price. The incumbents can't respond without annoying their existing customers who have grown accustomed to all the features the incumbent provides.  
A small fraction of users of a big service is often enough to run a small, non-VC funded business.  
The moment your goal shifts from VC-backed acquisition or public offering bid to "I'd like to support myself and some employees comfortably" the things you can do profitably become almost endless.   
Want to run a little webhosting business focused on small businesses? Tried and true. Want to offer custom software development for some little vertical? Easy enough. Want to just make a really nice and clean note app? That works too.  
When your goal of success shifts from "mind boggingly rich" to "sufficient for the lifestyle I want", it's much easier to be successful.  

#### Don't do startup for admiration
>> Many enjoy the experience of being admired or envied by others, perhaps even more than the original experience itself.People buy expensive watches, or cars, or houses where the maintenance cost itself reminds them every time of the downsides but other people's admiration more than makes up for it.Entire industries were created purely to satisfy such needs, anything containing "luxury" is a good point to start. 

In corporate culture people work to be in a position holding power and prestige. Their decisions are clouded by their basic instinct of being admired. Everyday decisions like what to do, whom to meet, where to spending more time on things. In time it appears that you are working towards a lot of things that don't make money but seems to drive interesting conversations  
When bootstarting a business, your instinct should be grounded on making money. Turning a profit. Every decision should be pivoted around that.   

Don't do startup if you can't face being rejected, rediculed and ignored.  
Don't do startup if you have constant need of admiration from others  

#### Seeing where things are headed is the essence of entrepreneurship
  You don't need to be the smartest guy, or the hardest-working. You don't need to be a extraordinary student or techno savvy. What sets entrepreneurs apart, is a tolerance for risk and an intuition about what will happen in the future.

You fire a lot of bullets. You don’t know which will turn into a cannonball. iPod was a bullet that turned to cannonball . Also when you fire a bullet fire it well so that you know it was not mistake in firing. Usually the second extension becomes the big one, intel memory chip to microprocessor, Apple iPod to iPhone : Jim Collins

#### On thinking that idea and software are the only essential parts

However additionally I would add that if you think that it is the software alone that will make or break the company, then it is obvious that this is your first time doing this and that you have never brought a product to market. There are a ton of examples where one product that was of less quality absolutely annihilated another excellent product where the difference was the rest of the "business" machinery (marketing, sales, support, operations, etc).

A successful startup requires all aspects of a business:

- leadership

- sales

- marketing

- market research

- competitor research

- product research

- product development

- product shipping & deployment

- contacts in key areas related to your business

- strategic planning

- financial management

- employee management

- investor management

- lots and lots and lots and lots of paperwork

- and of course a million other little things you discover along the way

#### On an Idea that's already implemented
You come up with a brilliant idea, you obsess over it, you Google some info, and on your screen lies your idea, being done by someone else, for the last two years. You’re all too familiar with that sinking feeling in your stomach that follows. You abandon the idea almost immediately after all that excitement and ideation.

First (as already mentioned), existing solutions prove your idea — their existence proves that you’re trying to solve a real problem that people might pay to have solved. And it proves that you’re heading in a direction that makes sense to others, too.

Second, and this is the biggie: The moment you see someone else’s solution, you mar and limit your ideas. It suddenly becomes a lot more difficult to think outside the box because before, you were exploring totally new territory. Your mind was pioneering in a frontier that had no paths. But now, you’ve seen someone else’s path. It becomes much harder to see any other potential paths. It becomes much harder to be freely creative.

Next time you come up with that great idea, don’t Google it for a week. Let your mind fester on the idea, allow it to grow like many branches from a trunk. Jot down all of the tangentially related but equally exciting ideas that inevitably follow. Allow your mind to take the idea far into new places. No, you won’t build 90% of them, but give yourself the time to enjoy exploring the idea totally.

When I do this, once I do Google for existing solutions, I usually find that all the other things I came up with in the ensuing week are far better than what’s already out there. I have more innovative ideas for where it could go next; I have a unique value proposition that the other folks haven’t figured out yet. But had I searched for them first, I never would have come up with those better ideas at all.

Finally, I’ll say this: if you see your idea has already been done and you no longer care about it, then it probably wasn’t something you were passionate enough about in the first place; it was just a neat idea to you.

In short term, the success of company would be dependent on market conditions, technology etc. On long term it is dependent on core skills of the person leading it. The material success of a company can be seen as a symptom of the personality traits of person leading the firm.    
For a startup, the person leading it should have deep unassailable charecterstics of profit seeking. This single strong personality trait will guide him through various decision making during early years of company. Like a craftsman moulding a claypot, the inner traits of the person would shape the company , chasing profit, as the force to to find ways in keeping the company alive and sustainable.  

The weaker this trait gets in the leading person, the higher the chances of dithering.  

As we go through different stages of life, our inclination towards these inner traits changes. It is through self evaluation, we need to realize where we are.   
A hardworking, kind and responsible person could that it takes much longer time and heavier effort to reach the same monetary goals than a profit seeking, egoistical person. An the latter person could find it similary hard in other endeavors

Companies can be analysed based on where you are, and where you are going.
- `where you are` : Is the net revenue, profit you make
- `where you are going` : Is the yearly growth rate.

For paying the bills, you need to look at `where you are` metrics. While investors would look at `where you are going` metrics as investment is a bet on future prospect of something.

A necessary skill for entrepreneur is to be a sales person.

Your idea is only a hobby until someone pays money to buy your product/service. 

Make something people will buy from you. At start don't worry too much about the money you make.

> Step one is to develop just enough to get couple of sales from target market segment. Validate the market from analysing the customer requirement. What ever happened till now is a pilot. A throwaway effort or code. Most of the time you would have no sale and go back to square one, trying something new.  Once you have crossed this stage, take it to beta level by putting proper software stack and practices in place. Start thinking about team , scalability etc.

> Hardest step in business is go from 0 to $1K recurring monthly profit. This will force you to get your market segment figured out and all the hard work done. Most people, from outside, think that difficulty in running business is linear and would put all the effort in developing fancy stuff based on their mental model of the problem. They know that running business is multi disciplinary process but underestimate on how steep is the difficulty , in each of those disciplines, during those first steps.

> For people who’re in a financial position to handle some paycheck risk, I’ts recommended to do a startup. Either from social background or by virtue of being in place and time where your skills are in great demand.

> money is to buy things that matter to you. If you value freedom, use your savings judicially.

> As a coder, the comfortable thing for me is always writing code. Before starting to write a single line of code, you need to do market research and understand the opportunity size. Building a business takes several years of personal investment. Enter into an existing market, rather than trying to find a new one.

> Once you have identified an idea or technology as the basis for your innovation-driven business. Your first goal is to assess the needs of potential customers, focusing on a target customer with the goal of achieving product–market fit—a product that matches what customers in a specific market are interested in buying, which unfortunately he failed accomplishing this step as the customers did not want to buy his product.
> The single necessary and sufficient condition for a business is a paying customer. The day someone pays you money for your product or service, you have a business, and not a day before. You cannot define a business as a product, because if nobody buys your product, you simply do not have a business. The marketplace is the final arbiter of success.
> Now, just because you have a paying customer does not mean you have a good business. In order to have a good, sustainable business, you will need to gain enough customers paying enough money within a relatively short period of time so you do not run out of capital, but instead, become profitable. And as a startup, you have few resources, so every action you take must be hyper-efficient.
> Therefore, you will not start by building a product or hiring developers or recruiting salespeople. Instead, you will take a customer-driven approach by finding an unmet need and building your business around it.

You get so much value from reading about specific aspects than from general startup books. Learn how each LEGO piece works and learn it well. You know, you’re going to have to rely on these specifics to actually get your business rolling.If you want to know something specific say accounting, read a book about that specific area. If you want to know more about the “general” aspects of startups - listen to interviews of founders about which unique chellenges they faced.

> The prospects for business ideas are not all the same. Some require investments at start or hard selling. The product is solving big company problem then it would require established company credibilty etc and long sales cycles.

1. Create more niche "properties" that provide a small to medium services. focus on something people might need, be willing to pay a small amount for, and ideally can run with minimal supervision.

2. Rinse repeat #1 until a few of those are ongoing. 8 euros per month becomes maybe 800 and growing over time.

3. Don't try to be Zuckerberg. There is only one of him, thank all the gods.

4. Don't even think about the words "startup", "exit", "investment" etc. Focus on stuff that will provide you with a lifestyle of your choice.

5. Try to make each "property" the best you can. Focus on making a "Good Product" (tm). Good products have better chance of being used. Give each one the love it needs. Stay focused. Complete the project. Take it slowly, there is no rush. You have no Boss here. No deadlines.

6. One of these days, one of those niche idea becomes semi-niche, broader audience. Go with it.

7. Remember there is no magic formula, no secret sauce, luck is a huge factor and there is no guarantee for anything.

8. Aim for lifestyle. It's a good aim.

In 2014, I was finally able to create a niche software product - www.legistracker.com which now creates some passive income. It is not a real business yet but it helps me pay off some of the bills. I was able to do it because realized I was looking in the wrong direction. The problem is that I never ASKED any potential customer what would be a good problem to solve. Without a paying customer, you have no viable product. What I would suggest is that you target small business owners what would help them in a. increase their sales or b. increase their productivity.
