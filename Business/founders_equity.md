### Ejection plan for founders
My #1 rule for ventures, especially with friends, is to create an “ejection seat plan” at the beginning. The ejection seat is designed to save friendships and prevent teams from holding on to ideas too long.  
Write down a list of milestones that must be achieved in 1, 2, 3, and then every 3 months up to 48 months. Agree that either partner can choose to eject without blame whenever the milestones aren’t met. Agree how much equity will be retained in the event of ejection. Follow the plan.  

### Book : Venture Deals (To understand relationship between company, founders and equity)  
https://www.amazon.com/Venture-Deals-Smarter-Lawyer-Capitalist/dp/1118443616   
This is a book that everyone who is about to start a business should read. Then re-read it again anytime when he is raising funds.  


### Protecting founders from each other  
"These are the legal concepts you can use to protect founders from each other, the company from the founders and founders from a hostile board.

Let's run an Example assuming I'll be your co-founder and the company will grant me 48,000 shares for each of the legal concepts (The number 48,000 was chosen to simply math but does not reflect typical number of shares per founder):

1 `Cliff`

- If founder stays less than 12 months, no equity.

Example: In this case I receive 0 of my 48,000 shares.

- After 12 months 25% of stock is instantly vested.

Example: In this case I receive 12,000 shares of my 48,000 shares.

2.`Vesting`

- After the cliff, founder vests 1/36th of granted stock each month.

Example: In this case I receive 1,000 shares a month, on top of my previously earned 12,000 shares after the cliff for a total of 48,000 shares over a total of four years. If I leave in month 24 my total number of shares is 24,000.

3 `Acceleration Triggers`

- Single trigger: all stock is vested upon change of control or sale of the company.

Example: Let's say Google buys our company in my month 24 of vesting, in order to prevent google from firing me right after the acquisition in order to stop my remaining 24,000 shares from vesting, all my shares accelerate are granted immediately, thus accelerating the vesting

- Double trigger: some stock is vested upon termination without just cause.

Example: This provides a dis-incentive from investors, the board, or a co-founder from firing me if I am not done vesting, in order to free up equity to hire a lot more other people, if I am fired and it's not due to committing a crime like fraud then I will earn some stock, normally 12 months, without having to remain at the company for 12 months."

### Example of four year vesting with 1 year cliff
Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson in their book Venture Deals claim that this 4 years vesting with 1 year cliff is the tech standard for vesting shares in a company.

That means that the employee will now have to work 4 years before they can get all of the equity that was promised to them. 
 
A 1-year cliff is a form of ‘probation’ if you will. They have to at least work one whole year before they can start to earn their equity. After that, the employee will receive ¼ of the equity promised each year. At the end of the fourth year of receiving equity they will have 100% of the equity promised.
