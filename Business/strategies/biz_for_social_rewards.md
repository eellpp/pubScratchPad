The work you do is personal but the rewards you get are social. Your skills are rewarded by society

Society decides whom to reward most based on the benefit it provides to them. A product/service that is useful out to lot of people will inherently get rewarded the most. 

An entrepreneurs goal is to drive the company towards maximum social acceptance and benefit
