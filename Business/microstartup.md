There are four things need to have a potential microstartup. 
1. Problem that has business potential and big enough  
2. Audience who has that burning problem 
3. Distribution channel to get the solution into users hands 
4. Business model aka pricing fit for the Problem-Audienc

### Success Stories
Made a fortune off two web sites that sat there and basically did their thing. I essentially did about an hour's work a week for 5 years and took home about $150,000 a year.
The first was a mortgage web site. I bought a domain for $6000 that matched a top mortgage search term. The front page of the site scraped the latest mortgage rates, and the rest of the site was well-written mortgage advice written by me and First Wife. The site just had a form you filled out to speak to a mortgage advisor. When it launched in like 2007 I got about $400 for each time the form was completed. (It was less after the Great Recession)   
......   
The other site was a private TV torrent tracker that closed in 2013 due to legal pressures. Barely touched the code in 7 years. It made a total of over $13m.  
.......  
I started working on this browser extension for Twitter 8 months ago.    
It took 3 months to reach $60/mo, 3 more to reach $400/mo, and 2 more to reach $3K/mo â€“ where I am now.

### How to do it 
1) Learn the tools to build your product.  

2) Research some product / markets, see what other products are out there. Chasing some noble idea, or "hidden gem" just to gain first-move advantage isn't all that, IMO. It's almost always better to join an existing market where proof of concept has already been done for you. Even better if the existing products are stagnant or lacking.  

3) Figure out a business and marketing plan, doesn't have to be the most complex thing in the world - but it forces you to do some research before just diving into something blindly.  

4) Start developing your MVP. Reach out to users in the relevant places, which means going to forums, twitter, subreddits, etc. Try your best to get user feedback, iterate your product on said feedback. Any money you get from donations, purchases, gifts, family, whatever should go towards infrastructure and marketing.  

5) With enough users, look into how you want to monetize your product. Ads? SaaS? Purchases? Lots of ways, but they all have their pros and cons.  

But, to be honest, it's a lot of work for a single developer. Especially if you're not already experienced with all the various aspects. You're basically gonna be doing everything on a smaller scale. Lots of things to learn, lots of things that can go wrong.  

And importantly, it can take years to build up a userbase large enough to live off the project. Sometimes you never grow to that size, and the product life-cycle has peaked, on its way downwards.  

The people that do this kind of stuff, have tried and failed multiple times before. But there's always something to learn, which you'll take to the next project.  

.....   
I used to work on frontend/backend/mobile/devops, so I have the advantage of doing everything on my own.

### Fast iteration to fail fast
You can find problems in your day to day life. Travelling is another way of discovering new problems. Every problem is not worth building a solution for. Only the burning ones with business potential.

Yes there were a few. But I try to always keep the cost of failure small. This is how I try to be frugal.  
- I see a potential problem, see if I can solve it. See if it's already being solved, if not I pitch the idea to few people. If atleast 50% got excited. I pick this idea to build
- I set a goal on day 1 on what the microstartup should achieve once its launched. 
- I try to take no more than 4 weeks to build it.
- I do a public launch in IH, PH, Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook and Reddit. In few weeks if I reach the goal that I set at the beginning, then I continue working on it to improve. If not then I will drop it and move on the next.

I would always try to do a quick launch, take no more than 4 weeks and launch it on PH, IH, Reddit, LinkedIn. The long term growth strategies are entirely different thing. But you will get basic validation. You are trying to fail fast.

Organic channels are your lifesavers, the ones which will make your microstartup successful, so start working on them from day 1.

I set a goal on day 1 on what the microstartup should achieve once its launched. Traction is something you define for yourself and your product.  


### Automation 
'Id say it's kind of possible when you use a solid framework and a homogeneous tech stack. For example, I run a few relatively big projects (millions of page-views per month), and I've achieved some solid automation through Ansible - both provisioning and deployments. The primary tech is Ruby on Rails + Postgres, and it's relatively easy to maintain current. As long as I keep all the projects up to date, things are under control. For example, bumping Ruby's version (or Rails) on one of the projects has an almost one-time cost, as long as I do that at the same time for all projects and document it.  

You need to distinguish between what _can_ be done and what _needs_ to be done. Let go of perfection and only do the necessary, then you can realize maintainance with very little time investment.  
This obviously does not work if you feel like all your code's libraries must always be on the newest version because simply keeping several projects' code running with the latest thing is quite a bit of work.  
I have a profitable project that is still running on PHP 5 on Ubuntu 14 and it seems that now I finally will have to upgrade things, but it will be a single upgrade now after many years that may take 1 day instead of 20 separate little ones that may have cost 1/2 day each if I always had kept up to date.  

### Marketing
Posting on Reddit or HN is fine, but unlikely to be successful if that is all you do. Cold calling/emailing/linkedin and posting on forums like HN continuously can both help. The latter only works if your solution genuinely solves someone's problem otherwise it will come off spammy. If your solution has obvious keywords and those keywords aren't too expensive, then Google ads can be relatively cheap method to get started too.  

launch deals and spread the word on Twitter and Slack communities.
- If you were one of the first 50 folks to sign up you locked in annual pricing for 50%, forever  

### Time to grow
Once launched with some intial growing subscribers, it will take 3 + years to reach to some compounding to kick in
- first $3000 MRR in 3 years
- next $3000 ($6000 MRR) in next 1 year (4 years)
- next $3000 ($9000 MRR) in next 6 month (4.5 years)
- next $3000 ($12000 MRR) in 3 months (4.8 years)
...

### Feedback from users . Make them feed involved
- On Twitter : teased new designs and features, documented decisions, and asked my audience for UX help with polls . This also fixes the marketing required for new feature release
- Posting one thread and a handful of tweets per week is the sweet spot 
- Suppliment the product related tweets with : Today I Learned .. tech posts etc ... targeting specific communities to grow audience. Like ruby, python etc  

### Growth
- In 3 months you should have 100+ MRR coming in from subscribing users.  

### Retrospective lessons
- Instead of spending too much time on designing, get a designer for the page UI  
- 

### Domains
Marketing App selling analytics, advertising or anything that lets markerters spend $$ amount and get back $$$ in return
