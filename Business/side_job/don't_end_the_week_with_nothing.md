### Keep Shipping and don't end the week with nothing

reading this email was valuable (knock on wood). Watching Jason's video is valuable. Rolling up your sleeves and actually shipping something is much, much more valuable. If you take no other advice from me ever, ship something. You'll learn more shipping a failure than you'll learn from reading about a thousand successes. And you stand an excellent chance of shipping a success -- people greatly overestimate how difficult this is.  

Just don't end the week with nothing

## Don't end the day with nothing
To end the week with something, then don't end the day with nothing that adds to the weeks accomplishments  
Keep pushing something everyday. However small.
