### Small Tools:  
Take note of questions that people ask in forums, at work or in social groups etc   
1. Is there a way to do this ?  
2. How would I make this?  
3. I wish someone could do this for me 
4. This is difficult to do and take away all my time
5. This daily chore, eats up my time



### Build, Market and Repeat

- right product in right place at the right time
- actually building and releasing something
- promoting it, letting the world know about him/it

We can't control the market timing so much, mainly because we can't accurately predict the future. With some research, maybe we can improve on this, but it's still no guarantee.

So, the best policy is to just stay in forward motion. Built a thing, promote it, and repeat. Maybe with 5 things in current operation, one of them catches.
