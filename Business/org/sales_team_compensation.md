Let’s start with the sales plan for an individual sales rep, or “account executive” (AE). The key elements of an AE sales plan are:

- Base Salary;
- Quota;
- Commission Rate;

Variable Pay (Quota times Commission Rate); and  
OTE (“on-target earnings”), the sum of the AE’s Base Salary and Variable Pay.   

This sounds like a lot of variables, but two industry standards allow us to simplify greatly:  
- The standard commission rate for SaaS products is 10%. For example, closing a $100,000 ARR deal generates a $10,000 commission.
- In constructing an OTE for an AE, a 50/50 split between base and variable compensation is typical. For an AE who’s hitting quota, their variable pay will equal their base salary. 

Taken together, these standards generate a third rule: the typical quota will equal 10x base salary. I call this the Rule of 10  

Once an AE hits quota in a quarter, their commission rate should increase to 15% on incremental sales. This “accelerator” incentivizes the best AEs to keep pushing past their target, instead of slowing down at a perceived finish line.  

For new AEs, the industry-standard time to hit productivity is 4 months  

If an AE is still not productive after 2 quarters, you may need to let them go or put them on a performance improvement plan.  

“Quota Capacity” (QC) refers to the total team quota. For example, if you have 10 AEs with quotas of $500k each, the team’s quota capacity will be $5 million  

### Manager commission
A manager’s quota should be set at 80% of their team’s QC. The manager’s OTE (also 50/50 between base and variable) will be set by market rates for a manager, director, or VP in their position. Commission rate will be the dependent variable. For example:

- Let’s assume a manager of 10 junior AEs ($5M QC) makes $200k OTE.
- $200k OTE means $100k base and $100k variable.
- 80% of quota would be $4M New ARR.
- Their commission rate at $4M New ARR needs to generate $100k of variable. 

Therefore, their commission rate is $100k/$4M = 2.5%.  

If the team is hitting over 80% of QC, that’s a sign you can hire more AEs. In fact, anything above 70% could warrant additional hiring as long as you have enough leads being generated at the top of funnel. Do not hire more AEs unless you can “keep them fed.”
