### ATuin
[Title](https://ellie.wtf/posts/i-quit-my-job-to-work-full-time-on-my-open-source-project)
How did I get here?

I started Atuin a few years ago now, to scratch an itch I had. I always felt that the shell should be easier to use, and that the state of shell history was the #1 problem there. I’d be googling commands that I knew I’d ran several times at some point in the past, or booting up my other laptop just to retrieve an incantation from earlier that week.

It turns out, a whole bunch of people felt the same.

Some people even contributed - thank you so much to the more-than-150 people who’ve taken the time to make a PR, no matter how large or small. An extra special thank you to those of you who’ve stuck around a bit longer 

At the beginning of 2023, I spoke at FOSDEM. I had a tonne of fantastic feedback about the tool, both in person and online. This was great for my motivation - after a couple of years, I was starting to feel tired as an OSS maintainer.

I started putting more time and energy into the project, which paid off very well. Our usage grew massively - more contributors, more signups, more active community members, more features in blogs/podcasts/etc. We also moved the GitHub repo from ellie/atuin, to atuinsh/atuin.

I also had to make some improvements to the infrastructure, mostly because we store a lot of data (encrypted blobs don’t compress well…). While it is possible to self host Atuin, many people use the hosted sync server. Some metrics:

We started 2023 with users uploading (in total) around 10,000 lines of history a day. We ended it with users uploading almost 200,000 lines a day.

I’d been paying out of pocket to run the Atuin servers the whole time. While not a huge amount, it also wasn’t tiny - 10s of millions of lines of encrypted shell history add up to a reasonably large amount of storage. Especially when you account for backups and moderate redundancy.

Towards the end of 2022, a friend suggested I setup GitHub sponsors. I didn’t think anything would come of it, but it did! After a few months I received enough sponsorship to cover the server bills, and to offset some of what I’d paid so far.

I really appreciate all of my sponsors for liking my work enough to contribute financially, when there’s no paywall or requirement whatsoever.


### Lead Generation funnel
... how beneficial it is to have a decently large highly engaged audience beforehand.
ConvertKit is an example of this.

The founder started by selling books and then made a course on how to sell books, got a pretty big audience around that and then started to build ConvertKit. Eventually he figured out who he wanted to market ConvertKit to and his prior audience of people wanting to sell things online was a great match. Naturally a lot of people who bought his books and courses are a great fit for his email service because the whole premise of his course on selling books is around building an email list. The books ended up being a lead generator for his SAAS app.   
... The majority of these “one man shows” are the result of years of work building an online audience, and then launching a business around that audience.   
Roam is another example. Without Conor having the Twitter audience he had and the hype around Roam, specifically on Twitter, they don’t hit $2m+ in rev their first month of turning on pricing.

Well, I had recently adopted an Australian Cattle Dog puppy but had a full time in-office job. They’re a very active breed and leaving her at home all day wasn’t an option. That prompted me to find a dog daycare, something I had never heard of (and honestly thought was slightly ridiculous). When checking out the first day, I noticed their business was a mess. Everything on paper, in messy stacks at the front desk. And then it took almost 5 minutes for them to be able to accept my card payment (one of my biggest pet peeves). That got me thinking- why isn’t there software in this niche? It turns out there was, but it was all CD-ROM software straight out of Windows 98 land. I didn’t know Jack shit about dog kennels so I emailed 10 local businesses asking if they’d beta test what I built and provide feedback. 1 wrote back so I drove over that day. The owner didn’t know anything about computers but he set me up with his manager- an aspiring product designer. We hit it off immediately and started collaborating. Eventually we became 50/50 business partners. Once we had built something we decided to show it off at a trade show. Turns out there was one in our city the following week! We bought a booth, and a shitty sign and 2 polo shirts and showed up. Every single person there lined up to see what we had built. We knew we had something. Got our first customer that day. Eventually it became more work than we could handle on nights / weekends, so I decided to pay my partner’s bills out of my own pocket (from my day job) so he could quit his and run the day to day until we had revenue to pay both our bills. We got there after a few months. After that, we worked 16 hours, 7 days a week for about a year. We started hiring people. The rest is history, as they say.  

Most Startups have this story. We come across the opportunities like this many times in life. Some even go ahead for few stages. But most falter. But it good to know what lies ahead  

1) Person has a personal grieve and seeks remedy. (In this case dog care)  
2) Notices issue in business he visits which stops them growing. (in this case, paper based handling and 5+ minutes for the business to accept payment)  
3) Person knows the solution (software automation) and goes out of the way to check out solutions in this space. (Finds only CD rom based software. Means outdated solutions in the niche)  
4) Person contacts other local businesses in the domain asking if they would beta test the solution and provide feedback. (1 out of 10 replies) Person makes direct meeting with the business that replies  
5) The business starts collaborating with person to solve their pain point. Person is building with features that solves their issues.  
6) Person gives partnership to business guy to be his domain marketer. They help him sell this software to other businesses in the domain  
7) They have customers and now lot of work to be done. 1 years of 16 hours/ 7 days work. 
8) Money starts rolling in and business model is established. They hire people and its a small successfull business.  

These are roughly the stages. Any number of things can go wrong during this. The steps may not follow the exact flow however the direction of steps is same.  
There is element on luck in here, meeting the right people etc  but that how things are.
