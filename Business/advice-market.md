>> I think it's Seth Godin who says (paraphrased): "people don't buy a product, they buy a story". You buy something because the story behind it is good, because it makes you feel good. And the story "you buy crap" does not make you feel good, while "best quality for the price" makes you feel like a clever money saver.  

Basically build a story around a product. Make people feel better while purchasing your product. They should feel smarter when in discussion about the product with others. This is way things have been sold from time immortal.

### Compete on price (cost strategy), or on value (differentiation strategy).
business school teaches you that you can compete on price (cost strategy), or on value (differentiation strategy).

if you compete on price, you’re betting that you are, or will be, the most efficient provider in the market (e.g., walmart and its supply chain dominance). it’s completely viable/acceptable to compete on price. what you don’t ever want to do is price on cost, rather than on value provided.

you can also compete on being better in many other dimensions, which is lumped into the broad differentiation strategy category. you are then betting that you are better on your dimension and that customers really value that dimension (more than price).  

A classic example (presented to my MBA class) was the two adjacent pizza parlors in NYC competing on price and driving the selling price of a pizza down to less than a dollar, whilst a shop a block away and around a corner was able to keep normal pricing. 

### Two types of entrepreneurs
Distinguish two kind of entrepreneurs. First who assembles crew and systems to fulfill existing need. Another who like Harley Davidson builds up a brand that people want to associate with thus going beyond the needs. People don't buy harley as a transport vehicle (for that you buy Suzuki). They buy to belong to a group having a distinct identity

### Fulfill existing market needs
Fulfill existing needs than inventing needs. If people are not buying what you showed them then either you are talking to wrong people or you have wrong product for the need. If they don’t tell other people then you are wrong, if yes then then you are on your way. Finding the right need product . Satisfy the need in a way that is not the cheapest. 

### First Ten kickstart strategy

Find ten people. Ten people who trust you/respect you/need you/listen to you…

Those ten people need what you have to sell, or want it. And if they love it, you win. If they love it, they’ll each find you ten more people (or a hundred or a thousand or, perhaps, just three). Repeat.

If they don’t love it, you need a new product. Start over
