### How I earn a living selling my open source software
https://www.indiehackers.com/post/how-i-earn-a-living-selling-my-open-source-software-476f6bb07e  
'm the founder and sole developer of my own open source software called open3A. It's a web-based invoicing application that I started in 2007 and have developed ever since.  

I initially developed open3A because I needed it myself to write invoices to my customers. When it was working I just put it out there in the internet because I thought someone else might find it useful. It was one of the first (maybe the first, idk) web-based solutions in this area after all.  

In fact someone found it useful and asked if I could add some features. I was still in the university and did it for free because I didn't think much of it. After a while he wanted to pay me money for my work and why should I have declined?   

Then others came and asked for more features which I implemented. Sometimes payed, sometimes free.  

After a while doing this I had collected quite a bit of functionality and thought about how I could sell open3A as a product and not only my time developing it
- I have a demo version directly on my homepage where anyone can try open3A without login or setup. 
- I have a free version of open3A which is as useful as possible without any limits but of course it is missing advanced functionality.  
- If someone wants advanced features, I have a shop. In my shop the users can buy many of the extensions I have developed over the years. The prices are reasonable and start at 20€ (~$24) up to around 80€ (~$96) or so. The price contains updates for this extension for one year which means the next two versions.  

### Turn a simple library to a business without overthinking on it

I wrote a Python library to scrape google news [0]  
We also have it as a service [1]  
Want to know why? Because devs who can't pay won't pay. Businesses who can pay will rather pay for a service (API in our case), and not care about maintaining it.
