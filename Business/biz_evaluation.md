### Three metrics to gauge business health
1) **Net Income**  
To calculate net income for a business, start with a company's total revenue. From this figure, subtract the business's expenses and operating costs to calculate the business's earnings before tax. Deduct tax from this amount to find the business's net income.  
2) **Cash Flow**  
Cash flow is the net amount of cash and cash-equivalents being transferred into and out of a business.  
- operating cash flow, 
- investing cash flow and 
- financing cash flow  
Positive cash flow indicates that a company's liquid assets are increasing, enabling it to settle debts, reinvest in its business, return money to shareholders, pay expenses and provide a buffer against future financial challenges.
3) **Free Cash Flow**  
Free cash flow = operating cash flow - capital expenditures - dividends (though some companies donâ€™t because dividends are viewed as discretionary)  
it shows what money the company has left over to expand the business or return to shareholders, after paying dividends, buying back stock or paying off debt.
