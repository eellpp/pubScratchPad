Successful ideas start small in experimental ways. Crude solutions which are fastest to production. Useful tools for self. Extremely flexible at the cost of aesthetics and stability.  
Idea's that start with a grandiose webapp plan with an apt domain name and requirements etc are formed in rigidity. Difficult to attain and not flexible.  
First prod version should be most flexible version.

> I think Dijkstra made a point that when somebody sees something new, they try to project something they know onto it - so with computers, the first thing people tried to do was make machines that thought like people- a project that's still bearing very little fruit. In the meantime, the things you could do really well with computers, like discrete maths, have been fabulously useful.
I suspect robots are a bit like that. They make very poor substitutes for people. But, they can do a lot of stuff ('dishwashers', for example), that are basically orthogonal to what people do, but reduce workload immensely.

Most people fall into this mental trap of projected thinking. The best ideas is to take the new thing and find the existing problems that can be fixed with this in shortest time/value/effort. Eg computers can be turned into robots doing household jobs is a grandiose thinking.You are just projecting what you know onto something new. But computer can help in accounting: is solving a problem which is one of the easiest application of computing to real world problems.
