> The history of business is littered with companies that got into business to do A, discovered they couldn't make that work unless someone tackled B, did B because nobody else was doing it well enough, then stopped doing A because they were doing so well at B.

Three essential skills for startups  
1. The ability to build software that meaningfully solves a customer's problem  
2. The ability to reach people who have the problem my software solves  
3. The persistence to grind until we have a decent product and can regularly reach people who have our problem.  

The above may seem like they're outcomes. But understanding problems and building solutions is a skill. Finding and reaching people is a skill. Grinding effectively is a skill.  
Every other skill (writing well, communicating well, selling the visions, giving good demos and customer service) is in service of the above.  

The three of them form a triangle. Each side of a triangle is as important as other.

> How did you tackle problem (2) above? trade shows or something? How do you go from 0 (no connections to industry X, or people who face problem Y) to being able to do 2 without some inside connection?    
- using Gabe Weinberg’s Bullseye framework.  
- re no connections to industry x - if you don’t have connections it means you probably don’t have the insight necessary to solve a problem for people in that industry. I’d probably look closer to home. If you really want to, reach out to people on LinkedIn and offer to pay the first couple for an hour of their time. Then reach out to more people and share insights from the first few. In short, add value. Soon you’ll be an expert.
