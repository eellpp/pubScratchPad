Here's an example of how a stable Apache project might move a new feature from idea to release:

1. **New Feature Proposal:**  
   A contributor opens an issue (for example, in JIRA) or proposes the feature on the project's mailing list.

2. **Community Discussion:**  
   The feature is discussed openly on the mailing list. Community members, committers, and maintainers review its merits, suggest improvements, and debate potential impacts.

3. **Design Proposal and Approval:**  
   If there’s consensus on the idea, a detailed design proposal is drafted. This document explains the rationale, the design approach, and how it fits within the existing architecture. The design is reviewed by committers and may require informal or formal approval before proceeding.

4. **Implementation & Patch Submission:**  
   Once approved, the contributor (or a group) develops the feature. The code is submitted as one or more patches, often via the project's issue tracker or a Git pull request.

5. **Code Review and Testing:**  
   Committers and other community members review the submitted code. Automated tests (and sometimes manual tests) run to ensure that the new feature integrates well and doesn't break existing functionality. Feedback may result in further revisions.

6. **Merging into the Main Codebase:**  
   After the code passes review and testing, a committer merges it into the project's main branch.

7. **Release Candidate (RC) Testing:**  
   When the project prepares a new release, the integrated feature is included in a release candidate build. This candidate is tested by a broader group of users to identify any unforeseen issues.

8. **Formal Committer Vote/Approval:**  
   Before finalizing the release, committers hold a final review (and often a vote) to ensure that the release candidate is stable and the new features (including the one in question) meet quality and compatibility standards.

9. **Official Release:**  
   Once approved, the release candidate becomes the official release, and the new feature is now part of the stable project.

### Summary

- **Open Discussion:** Ensures all voices are heard and the feature aligns with community needs.  
- **Rigorous Reviews:** Code reviews and testing safeguard the project’s stability.  
- **Structured Approval:** Formal steps (like a committer vote) add an extra layer of quality assurance before release.

This process, rooted in "The Apache Way," ensures that every new feature is thoroughly vetted and reviewed before it becomes part of a stable release.
