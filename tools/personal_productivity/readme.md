Think of Your Desk Like a Cockpit  
Everythin needed is within arm's reach for the pilotâ€”and it leaves out extraneous information or tools that could be distracting   

For the most efficient, distraction-free use of your space:
1. Keep only the things you use daily within reach. This could be a pen and a notebook, your phone charging stand, your water bottle or coffee cup, and a microfiber cloth for cleaning your phone screen and monitor.   

2. Store supplies you might need weekly or monthly, such as scissors or extra Post-It notes, in your desk drawers; paper files you don't touch regularly in their own file cabinet or box; and things you use once in a blue moon, such as printer photo paper, as far away from your desk as you like. 

3. Keep personal decorations to a minimum

4. Hide supplies and tools strategically behind your monitor or under your desk. You can still have things you need in reach but hidden from sight. 

5. Take a few minutes at the end of each workday to remove the things that have somehow strayed onto your desk and don't belong there. A cleared desk will give you a fresh start the next morning and keep the momentum going throughout the day.

### Left to Right setup
Left side of the desk is for incoming items. Right side is for what is being done and done.   
- All supplies are on left side. As they are used daily, they at put on right side. End of day they go back to left side.  
- Left monitor has incoming items. Right monitor is working monitor
