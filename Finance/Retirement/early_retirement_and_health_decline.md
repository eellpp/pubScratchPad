Not only early retirement but any kind of retirement that gets the retiree in a mode that they don't have to try anymore will result in cognitive decline.  

My experience with both my parents was "I retired and I don't want to use my brain anymore," and they have both definitely experienced decline since retirement. Some of my friends' parents, however, have adopted more of a "I'm retired and now I can dedicate all my brainpower to these special projects I've always wanted to focus my energy on." These people have mostly declined not at all or very little. I think the answer is not to retire and go rot in a chair while taking 5 naps a day.  

Anecdotally, my grandfather is 92 or so and still works as a journalist (reduced hours). He is still super sharp and does yoga every day. Blows my mind.  
If anything, I'd believe that someone who had the drive to do challenging activities on their own (and engage socially with others) is doing more for their mind and body than someone clocking in and out at a boring job.

My grandfather and father-in-law have both got dementia in 2 years after their retirement. My Father even got heart disease after retirement.  
I have long believed not working or not being active both physically and mentally is harmful to one's health.  
Keep yourself occupied in some way or the other. Human mind and body needs some engagement to work well. Too much of rest is as harmful as fatigue.  

decades of work destroy internal motivation and leave people directionless in the absence of someone to tell them what to do

Sitting around May Speed Up Cognitive Decline.  
Both my Grandfathers retired shortly before seventy. One sat down in his Chair and did not get up. He ignored his health, and passed within 10 years.  
The other is highly active in his community and church, still gardens, and travels constantly. He is in his mid 80s with no sign of slowing down. Barring a major health incident, he will live well into his 90s like his mother, and may pass 100.  

### Exercise 
Extreme workout is bad for joints/body with age. 
- do moderate strength exercises  
- sprint short distance  

### Social Activity
social activities are even more important than mentally stimulating activities.  





### Late Masters and PHD
Before I started, I was pretty concerned about whether I would be able to do this even. Most of my peers are in their 20s and 30s, though it was surprising to me when I started this program that I am not the oldest candidate and there are a couple of us in the higher age ranges. Anyway, I had wondered if I would be able to keep up with the youngsters. In fact, I don't think it has been an issue at all. I think that I am performing at least at as high of or possibly a higher level today than during my first run at graduate education.

I think there are certain factors that I, as an older, more settled, less let's-start-living-life(!) person have as an advantage over my young peers. Many of them still focus a lot of time on socializing, whereas I have my spouse and kids and old friends whom I don't have to see every weekend (the old friends--I see my spouse and kids every day). My younger colleagues do a lot of dumb things still, ones that I sure did also when I was that age and have gotten out of my system.
