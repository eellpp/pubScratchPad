> In retirement, it’s your income, not your wealth that creates your standard-of-living. You’re not going to want to take a pay cut.

Goal is to have inflation-adjusted income during retirement  

### Who is constrained Investor
To determine if someone is a constrained investor, calculate the ratio of their minimum annual living expenses (net of Social Security and pension income) to the value of their investment assets. If that ratio is greater than 3%, they are a constrained investor.  

Due to their unconditional reliance on savings to produce required monthly income, constrained investors often express the desire for a threshold monthly income that is certain.

minimum annual living expenses (net of Social Security and pension income) / value of their investment assets

- The first order priority of the constrained investor’s income strategy is risk mitigation.
- hybrid strategy

### seven-segment hybrid strategy.
 blending of time-segmentation (“bucketing”) with “flooring,” via lifetime income from an annuity. This hybrid strategy provides the answer to what ails constrained investors.  

 Continuous safe paychecks represent a key advantage of the hybrid strategy. 



7 seven segment hybrid plan will have three major components:

1. Five, five-year segments to produce income over a 25-year period. 
If the ROR targets are realized, the five segments will produce 25 years of inflation-adjusted income

2. A sixth segment in the form of an aggressively invested, fully-liquid, 25-year-hold capital appreciation account. Its purpose is to provide additional old-age income, or, to serve as a legacy for Terri’s grandchildren, or, to offset costs associated with long-term care; and

3. A seventh segment, funded by an annuity that, beginning in year 11, will pay Terri $2,000/month for life.


Terri will receive monthly income in five-year sequences. As each new sequence begins, Terri’s income will increase by an amount that is the equivalent of a 3% annual inflation adjustment. The 3% inflation target is the assumed inflation rate that Mark recommended for Terri’s strategy.


**Segment 1**.  
Segment 1 is a cash-equivalent vehicle that liquidates itself over 60 months.  (at rate of return 1%)

Segment one’s benefits are as much psychological as economic.With the confidence that her paycheck is secure, the importance of which cannot be overestimated, Terri gains peace-of-mind and staying power. She is anchored to the strategy by segment 1.

**Segment 2**.   
(@ rate of return 3%). 
When segment 1 is fully depleted, the money in segment 2, which has been accumulating for five years, is brought into a safe money orientation, exactly like segment 1. Segment 2 then provides Terri another five years of safe paychecks, but with a step-up. From the standpoint of income, we have covered the first 10 years of the retirement with no risk.

Because Terri’s income is secure over the first decade, the income from the “floor” annuity is not needed until year 11



**Segment 3**.  
(@ rate of return 4%). 
Segment 3 is invested for 10 years. 40% to 50% allocation to equities.


**Segment 4**.   
(@ rate of return 5%). 

Segment 4 is invested for 15 years


**Segment 5**.  
(@ rate of return 6%)
Segment 5 is invested for 20 years


**Segment 6**.  
(@ rate of return 7%)
Segment 6 is invested for 25 years. segment 6 has aggressive investment orientation
