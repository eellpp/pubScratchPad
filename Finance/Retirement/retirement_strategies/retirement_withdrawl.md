### 4% withdrawl rule
The infamous 4% rule traces to a study in 1994 by William Bengen, a financial planner, which appeared in the Journal of Financial Planning. He based the rule on calculations showing that a portfolio of 50% stocks/50% bonds would have survived every 30-year period in the U.S. between 1926 and 1991

Under the 4% rule, a $1 million 401(k) would allow you to spend an inflation-adjusted $40,000 each year in retirement with minimal odds of outliving your money. With the new rule, you would be able to spend an inflation-adjusted amount of just $19,000 per year.  

the much-lower spending rule they arrived at traces to two primary causes. 
1. The first is accounting for our expected longevity.A 65-year old couple retiring today has nearly a one out of four chance of at least one spouse surviving more than 30 years.  
2. The second cause of the much lower spending rate had an even bigger impact: The researchers relied on a much more comprehensive database of historical stock and bond returns and inflation. Specifically, their database reflected returns from 38 developed countries between 1890 and 2019, containing in total nearly 2,500 years of stock, bond, and inflation data.
