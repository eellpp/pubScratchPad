### To retire at 65, you need 6 times annual income invested at 50, then continue working for next 15 years
most financial advisors recommend that you have between five and six times your annual income in a 401(k) account or other retirement savings account by age 50. With continued growth over the rest of your working career, this amount should generally let you have enough in savings to retire comfortably by age 65.


### Retirement income should be 80% of pre retirement income. Or at least 50%
As your expenses would be lower in retirement. However your medical expenses could rise.   

### Retirement Account and Social security withdrawl
Subtract your annual expense in retirement from Social Security. The rest is annual withdrawl from retirement fund. 
Divinde it by 0.04 to get the amount you need in retirement fund.  

### The 4% withdrawl will be withdrawing amount at replacement rate
The 4% rule may entail withdrawing too much. It comes from, in part, conservative estimates of your retirement fund’s returns. By the time you retire you should have shifted your portfolio to safe assets. Many retirement funds, with comparatively safe assets, will have a return rate of around 3% to 5% by this point, allowing you to hover right around the replacement rate for your withdrawals.

**Someone who is earning 100K at 50 , trying to get 80K in retirement income at age 65**. 
At age 50, then, many experts suggest that this retiree would need to have – at a bare minimum – around $600,000 up in a 401(k), or other tax-advantaged account. 
Someone who earns $100,000 per year will want to have around $1.5 million in their retirement fund by age 65.   

If 5% is investment repleshment rate, then withdrawing 75K per year will still keep the principal safe.   

Having 600K by 50 would give the retiree 15 years to boost their retirement nest egg by an additional $900,000, or grow by an average of $60,000 annually for each of the next 15 years. That is unlikely to happen without significant capital appreciation in the retiree’s tax-advantaged account. Many advisors recommend seeking a rate of return around 7% to 8% to reach the needed $1.5 million.

During the 15 year, period the retiree should still keep working, but not contributing to the retirement fund. Just to keep the monthly expense going.

### 120K per year in retirement income would need 6m in savings

For example, let’s say you made $150,000 per year during your working life; we’ll assume a higher-income household since you have saved up $6 million. You would want to plan for a retirement account that can generate $120,000 per year throughout your retirement (80% of $150,000).

Even without returns of any kind, just coasting on principal, a $6 million portfolio can pay you $120,000 per year for 50 years. For someone who retires at 55, that will give you retirement savings to live until you’re 105 years old and this is even before we account for Social Security.
