While Garrett is 72 and already receiving Social Security benefits, Angela is just 61. Thankfully, this couple is placing only modest demands on their portfolio currently, because they’re both still working. Because her job is physically taxing, though, Angela would like to retire within the next few years, ideally at age 63. As their retirement date draws close, they wrote in to seek a second opinion on their portfolio, their plan, and their anticipated in-retirement spending.

Kate, 44, and her husband Eric, 51, are earning serious money for the first time in their adult lives. The challenge today? How to make up for lost time. “This is by far the most income we’ve had,” Kate wrote, “and we are pouring it into savings.” In their email to me, Kate and Eric were crystal-clear about their goals: “To have at least $3 million in retirement/investments in 18 years; to establish a strong cash savings; to pay off our house by 2040; and to save $80,000-$100,000 for our children’s college education.”

Gina is experiencing serious market volatility for the first time during her retirement, and it doesn’t feel great. At 72, this biomedical engineer has been retired for about seven years, and she has amassed a solid portfolio. But her parents were both long-lived—92 and 99—so Gina is concerned about the prospect of outliving her nest egg, particularly now that both stocks and bonds have logged losses in 2022 and her portfolio has taken a hit.

Logan and Sydney, both age 69, are extremely active and live in a sunny part of the country where they can enjoy biking and hiking year-round. Sydney continues to teach Spanish at the local community college and also conducts private tutoring. Thanks to income from Sydney’s job and a modest level of spending, the couple hasn’t begun drawing any funds from their nest egg. Yet, even as the couple is highly content with their life right now, a big change is looming: Sydney would like to retire within the next few years. Her retirement, as well as their plans to begin collecting Social Security late next year and required minimum distributions from their IRAs beginning two years after that, prompted the couple to seek a second opinion on their portfolio’s positioning.
