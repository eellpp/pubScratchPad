## Planning by Age 

### Age 40's
This is the decade when you may be seeing more money in your paychecks, thanks to raises or job changes. And retirement suddenly doesn’t look impossibly far away. At some point in this decade, you’ll likely have been working longer than the time you have left until retirement.

Of course, financial obligations don’t disappear in the 40s—there’s likely still a mortgage to pay, children’s college funds, perhaps elderly parents to assist…the list goes on. But the goal should be to put away 10% to 15% of your salary for retirement and throw in a little extra cash from raises or side gigs.

Consider doing this: 

1. Pay attention to lifestyle creep. Salaries often go up with age, but if you can avoid growing your expenses in line with those higher earnings, you can supercharge your retirement accounts. Again, review subscriptions and memberships, reduce spending on items and services that aren’t worthwhile and put that extra money to work for your future. 
2. Set up important documents, such as wills and healthcare proxies. A lot of Americans think they don’t need estate planning if they’re not millionaires, but that can’t be further from the truth. Without this, a judge will decide how your assets are distributed or who cares for minor children should you die. If you already have these documents, take the time to review them.
3. Look over listed beneficiaries on retirement accounts and life insurance policies too; you don’t want those benefits going to the wrong person (like an ex).

### Age 50's
Now retirement really isn’t that far away. So spend more time thinking about when you want to retire and what your expenses might be. Take an honest look at your finances. Estimate your Social Security benefits using a My SSA account with the Social Security Administration, and run a few scenarios of retirement income and needs.  

Retirement accounts allow catch-up contributions for people 50 and older, so take this opportunity to increase your savings.

Your retirement accounts should still have a healthy amount of stocks as that money needs to grow for decades to come, but build up funds that you can tap in the event of a market downturn at the start of your retirement instead of being forced to sell investments.

Try these tips in your 50s: 

1. Keep analyzing your spending (this is one of those perpetual rules of thumbs in the personal finance world!) 
2. Talk with a financial planner, or even an adviser at the firm housing your retirement accounts if you don’t want to work with a professional more closely, to review your asset allocation; are you properly invested for the future, or too heavily in equities or bonds? 
3. Create a My SSA account, which allows you to see an estimate of your Social Security benefits as well as review your work history. As a bonus, this can protect you against identity theft. 


### Age 60's and 70's
These are the decades when most people want to stop working. While you may not control the timing, you still can do plenty to secure your finances.

Don’t go into retirement blindly. Analyze your income sources in retirement: Social Security, savings (including retirement accounts), pensions and anything else. Should you look into an annuity, after careful consideration and guidance from a trusted professional?

Think carefully about when you will claim Social Security. People can begin receiving their Social Security benefits at age 62, but not everyone should. Americans who paid into the system and are fully covered get 100% of their benefits at their Full Retirement Age, which depends on their birth date. Those who claim prior to their FRA get a reduction for every month before that FRA, while people who delay their benefits up until age 70 get a bonus. 

Not everyone can afford to delay Social Security benefits, even for one year. Just know that the decision, whatever it is, also impacts spousal and dependent benefits.

And just because retirement is here doesn’t mean portfolios should become mostly invested in bonds. Yes, retirees do need the protection fixed assets provide, but retirement can last another two or three decades. Without a healthy mix of stocks and bonds, you may run the risk of running out of money in old age.

Do this in your 60s and 70s: 

1. Take account of all of your assets and liabilities — and the type of any debt you have. For example, a reasonable mortgage isn’t necessarily bad in retirement if it fits into the overall budget and spending plan, but consumer debt should be squashed before retiring. 
2. While in your early 60s and healthy, consider long-term-care insurance. Not interested in that type of policy? That’s fine, but have a plan for how you’ll pay for at-home aides, a nursing home or other long-term care needs. 
3. Focus on your health, not just your finances. Stay active, learn a new skill, take on a hobby, call up family and friends. 
4. Maintain a comfortable portfolio mix, one that isn’t so conservative that investments no longer grow over the next few decades but one that isn’t so risky you could lose all your hard-earned savings.
