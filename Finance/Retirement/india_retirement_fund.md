### Based on PPP

 Assuming that USD $1 million is good enough to retire in US. (cash + investments. Not including the value of residing house)  
 PPP in 2018 was 18.  
 The amount required to retire in india in 2018 is 1.8cr Rs.  
 Which translates to 400k SGD cash + investments (Without any debt obligation )  
 
 ### Three percent yearly expense drawn
 For early retirement, you can draw 3% every year to beat inflation. (Check out the average inflation rate for past 5 years)  
 3% of 400k$ = 12K/Year. Means around 1K SGD per month (@2020).  Which seems like decent living expense (without any loans and rents)
