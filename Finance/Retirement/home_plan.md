### How you don't need to own too much stuff
'Just start by going camping. You will soon find out what you really need versus what you think you need.  Life here is peaceful, safe and fulfilling.'  

### Focus more on essentials. 
Life is the coffee and career/money/social-position/society-at-large etc are the cups. Its easy to get lost in chasing the most wanted cups.Not realizing that coffee was what it mattered the most.
