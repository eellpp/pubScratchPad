### Waiting period for pre existing illness
The basic understanding of the waiting period is that you cannot claim health insurance immediately after buying a healthcare policy. The policyholder must wait for a set time frame that ranges from 30 days to 4 years. The waiting period is the duration of time during which the insurance company will not compensate you for a claim related to your pre-existing ailment.

In such a case, you would have to bear the expenses out of your pocket. The first 30 days after buying a healthcare plan is the initial waiting period, constant for all types of health insurance policies. You cannot avail of an insurance claim for any treatment in this initial waiting period. A medical insurance plan will cover pre-existing illnesses after the waiting period is over.

The waiting period can vary from insurer to insurer and also depend on the type of illness, policy, age, and other similar factors. It can typically be between two years to four years.


### Payment Types 
**Cashless treatment**.  
The insurance companies usually have tie-ups with several hospitals and medical facilities. This offers two types of benefits to the policyholders of indemnity-based health insurance plans. Firstly, they enjoy the flexibility to choose from several hospitals and medical facilities which provide quality treatment. Secondly, at these partner hospitals, one is eligible for availing a cashless treatment i.e. the medical bill is directly settled by the insurance provider with the hospital and the policyholder need not pay anything (except co-payment share) from his pocket. A list of nearest hospitals with cashless facilities can be checked before buying health insurance.


**Co-payment and sub-limits**. 

In health insurance, co-payment refers to the portion of the medical bill that is agreed to be paid by the policyholder and not the insurance provider. It can be given as a fixed amount or a fixed percentage of the treatment expense. “Most of the indemnity-based health insurance plans come with a co-payment option. Plans with higher co-pay components usually have lower premium payout requirements," said Agrawal.
For instance, Mr A has a health insurance plan which provides him with a health cover of ₹5 lakh, featuring a co-payment of ₹50,000. Mr A had a medical emergency because of which he had to get hospitalised. His medical treatment bill came out as ₹5 lakh. Then out of this ₹5 lakh, ₹50,000 would have to be paid by Mr A and the remaining ₹4.5 lakh would be paid by his insurance provider.

individuals were restricted to purchasing new insurance policies only until the age of 65. 

IRDAI has decreased the health insurance waiting period from 48 months to 36 months. According to the insurance regulator, all pre-existing conditions should be covered after 36 months, regardless of whether the policyholder disclosed them initially or not. Put simply, health insurers are prohibited from rejecting claims based on pre-existing conditions after these 36 months.

The insurance companies are barred from introducing indemnity-based health policies, which compensate for hospital expenses. Instead, they are only permitted to provide benefit-based policies, offering fixed costs upon the occurrence of a covered disease.

Indemnity-based health insurance policies are medical insurance policies where the insured is paid for the actual hospitalization expenses incurred during the treatment up to the total policy sum insured amount.
