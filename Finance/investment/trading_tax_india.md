### CA Audit of trading account for tax benefits
It seems that if we trade in equities in Indian markets and our profitability is lower than 8% of our trades value, our accounts must be audited by a CA. That’s true even if you make loses. That’s my understanding as per guidelines on Zerodha and some other sites anyway.

So essentially, that means we have to pay a CA come 5-10k to claim tax benefits on trading loses.

### Taxation when investing Foreign equity
Overall, only invest in foreign equities if the amount involved is decent - INR 5-6 lakh seems like a good rule of thumb. The expenses and compliance burden is significant otherwise.

Now I made my mind that all these tax hassles are not needed when I can invest in the best US index like sp500 or nasdaq 100 at a low cost domestically via the mutual fund route.
