FMPs are closed-end debt funds having a fixed maturity period. Unlike other open-ended debt funds.

The fund house comes up with a New Fund Offer (NFO) for a specific duration. NFO will have an opening date and a closing date. You may invest in the NFO only during these days. Upon expiry of the closing date, the offer to invest ceases to exist.

The value of your FMP is reflected by the fund Net Asset Value (NAV). You will get to know the NAV of the FMP on a daily basis. The point to be underscored here is that NAV of the fund fluctuates every day. It is affected by the interest rate movements in the economy. This makes FMPs riskier than FDs.

### FMP vs other debt funds
Unlike other debt funds, the fund manager of FMP follows a buy and hold strategy. There is no frequent buying and selling of debt securities like other debt funds. This helps to keep the expense ratio of FMPs at lower level vis-a-vis other debt funds.

### FMP vs FD
FD is secure with assured returns. FMP is indicative returns which can be higher or lower\
FD has higher liquidity\
With indexation FMP has lower tax. In FD, the interest earned is added as income and taxed

### things to consider
If you are thinking about investing in Fixed Maturity Plans, remember – these are not fixed deposits but mutual funds schemes.

Look for the investment objective of the scheme, indicated yield and investment strategy. Once you are in sync with these, invest an amount that you can leave invested for three years and reap tax-efficient returns.

### what is indexation benefit
Gains from the sale of debt mutual fund units are classified as capital gains, which allows the investor to use indexation while computing tax on them. This is applicable on long-term capital gains on investments that have been held for 3 years and more.

Let’s say you invested in a debt fund in May 2014. Your investment amount was ₹10,000 and you bought the units at an NAV of ₹10. Three years later, you redeemed your investments in June 2017 at an NAV of ₹20.

Hence, when you sold your investments, the value of your investments was ₹20,000. Your investment made capital gains worth ₹10,000. However, you need not pay tax on this entire amount of ₹10,000.

As your holding period was 3 years, you will get the benefit of indexation to reduce the value of your long-term capital gains.

To arrive at the Indexed Cost of Acquisition (ICoA), you have to use the following formula:

ICoA = Original cost of acquisition * (CII of year of sale/CII of year of purchase)

In the above example, the indexed cost of acquisition will be 11,980 (10,000 * 1125/939). Hence, instead of ₹10,000, your capital gains will now be ₹8,020 (₹20,000 – ₹11,980).

Using indexation, you managed to not pay tax on nearly ₹2,000 of your gains. Your tax will be computed on only ₹8,020, which will be equal to ₹1,604.

The benefit of indexation works best when your holding period is longer. For a holding period of 5 years, long-term capital gains tax on debt funds can come down from 20% to 6-7%.

This is how indexation helps you to save tax on gains from debt mutual funds and enhance your earnings.
