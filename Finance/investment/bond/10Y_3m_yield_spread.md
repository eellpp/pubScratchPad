Series is calculated as the spread between 10-Year Treasury Constant Maturity (BC_10YEAR) and 3-Month Treasury Constant Maturity (BC_3MONTH). 

In good times, investor seeks to seek riskier non-government investment opportunities and long term interest rates are high. When recession is in horizon, they seek to invest in gov bonds and long term interest rate go lower.  

This is the chart that gives a sense of pulse of the market.

The yield spread indicates the likelihood of a recession or recovery one year forward. The spread equals the difference between the short-term borrowing rate set by the Federal Reserve (the Fed) and the interest rate on the 10-year Treasury Note, determined by bond market activity.  

### Negative and narrow curves indicates recession  
Generally the spread is positive. Means long term interest rates are higher than short term.   
An “inversion” of the yield curve, in which short-maturity interest rates exceed long-maturity rates, is typically associated with a recession in the near future.

After over a decade of positive activity, the yield spread went negative in mid-2019 for an extended time, bouncing back into positive territory towards year’s end. 2019’s four-month inversion was the result of higher short-term interest rates stimulated by the Fed and lower long-term rates as the economy slowed and bond market investors saw fewer investment opportunities, and followed a long downward trend that began in 2014.
