Bonds affect the stock market by competing with stocks for investors' dollars. Bonds are safer than stocks, but they offer a lower return. As a result, when stocks go up in value, bonds go down.  

Stocks do well when the economy is booming. When consumers are making more purchases, companies receive higher earnings thanks to higher demand, and investors feel confident. One of the best ways to beat inflation is to sell bonds and buy stocks when the economy is doing well. When the economy slows, consumers buy less, corporate profits fall, and stock prices decline. That's when investors prefer the regular interest payments guaranteed by bonds.  

Sometimes, both stocks and bonds can go up in value at the same time. This happens when there is too much money, or liquidity, chasing too few investments. It happens at the top of the market. It could occur when some investors are optimistic and others are pessimistic.

There also are times when stocks and bonds both fall. That's when investors are in a panic and selling everything. During those times, gold prices often rise  

### Stocks
Stock market valuations and price-to-earnings multiples are largely a function of interest rates. When interest rates are falling over time, multiples tend to expand as the price of money becomes cheap. The easier it is to borrow at low rates, the better it is for paper assets, in terms of cheap capital supporting high stock-market multiples. 

When interest rates are rising, on the other hand, multiples tend to contract (shrink) as the price of money becomes expensive. As yields go up, it gets harder for investors and businesses to borrow cheaply and to fund aggressive projects  

As a general rule, this means less capital available to support high price-to-earnings multiples. With less capital chasing asset returns, there are fewer bidders in the market, and so the multiples tend to shrink.

This is why, to a significant degree, we can say the bond market (which determines the level of long-term interest rates) drives the stock market.

Inflation expectations, or a lack thereof, determine the level of interest rates, which in turn determine whether the price of money (how much it costs to borrow) is cheap or expensive.  

### 40 Year Bond Bull market in US (1981 - 2021)
for the past 40 years, more or less, U.S. treasury bond prices have been going up, and then up some more, in the greatest bull market of all time.

The rise of the 30-year bond market is the flipside of the fact that U.S. interest rates have more or less been falling for four decades â€” ever since they peaked in September 1981.   
It was September 1981 when interest rates last peaked and treasury bonds bottomed, setting the stage for a multi-generational rise in bond prices (and fall in yields) that took equities along for the ride.
