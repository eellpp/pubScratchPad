The yield on a bond is inverse to its price, which means that, as bond prices fall, yields go up. You can think of the price like a child sitting on one end of a see-saw, and the yield, or interest rate, as a child at the other end of the see-saw. As the bond price rises, the yield falls and vice versa.   

This is a mathematical relationship because the "coupon" of the bond — the amount it pays out each year — is fixed.  

Say a bond is issued with a coupon yield of 8%. This means that, if you buy the bond at "par," meaning exactly 100% of the issue price — you will get $8 per year for every $100 that you invest, which works out to 8% exactly.  

But now let's say you buy the bond at 130, or 130% of the issue price. Now you are paying $130 for the same $8 coupon, which means your yield is reduced to just over 6%, because an $8 coupon is about a 6% yield on a $130 investment.  

It also works in reverse: Say you are able to buy the bond at 80, meaning 80% of the issue price. In this instance you would get $8 of yield on an $80 investment, for a yield of 10%.
