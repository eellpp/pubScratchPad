### Stock Valuation
Stocks are valued based on discounted cash flow (in general and over the long term. Plenty of short-term exceptions, i.e. Tesla future earnings costing 18x more than Fords future earnings).

A higher interest rate, i.e. inflation, lowers the value of those future earnings.

Stock prices are the price people are paying for future earnings. High price to earnings assumes low inflation in future generally (A good economic environment). This might make sense if we assume low inflation for the next 30 years. It does not make sense in a high inflation scenario  

### Emergency Fund
 An emergency fund is typically needed at the worst possible time, when the economy isn't good and investments are deflated. That's the liquidity risk you take with anything but cash.  
This is not stocks, funds or bonds. But emergency fund is cash on hand.  

### Savings 
The general rule of thumb is 6 months of savings. I've known many that didn't follow this rule, and ended up in very bad debt.
