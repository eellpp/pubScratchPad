Insurance for stocks seems like a far fetched idea to new investors. This is because the explanationof the concept of insurance becomes full of jargon.

### Why insure your stocks?

A list of things we insure to preserve value and protect ourselves from accidents and theft:  
1- House/Property  
2- Car(s)  
3- Phones  
4- Computer  
5- Life  
6- Other high priced items.  

All of these have somethings in common:
1- High value  
2- Possible accident potential3- Our inability to fix on our own4- Value store for uncertain times  

We can rewrite the list above in a single line as:  
High priced items which might lose value due to reasons we cannot predict.  
The list does not include one of our second/third largest high price items i.e. Investments in shares.  

### How to insure your stocks?
We see the problem, now we need to find a solution.  
In stocks, insurance is called a PUT option. But not all stocks can get insurance.  
This is an interesting proposition should you have stocks in your portfolio that no one is willing to insure?I would want to keep a very small percentage think 1-2% of the portfolio in stockswhich can't be insured.  
Before we invest a big chunk of our money into a stock we should look whether we can getinsurance on it.  

### How to check whether we can get insurance:
1- Go to www.nseindia.com  
2- In the search box type the name of the share, select the share from the dropdown.3- See if the following marked in red is showing, click it and we see the option chain.  
If the option chain is present we can go ahead and decide to buy the stock.Note: Insurance is available on a lot of shares, think of this as house insurance is availablebut a single room in a house can't be insured. What is a lot of shares? See the guide here.

So we have now invested into a lot worth of shares. Lets assume the lot is 200 shares.Our aim is to make sure the value of the stockdoesn't go down too much let us say we are OK with a 20% loss in share value and the current share price is: 100.If the stock goes down to 80 we are fine but we want to protect ourselves from any further loss. We ask the insurancecompany to insure the value at 80 i.e. if price goes to 60 we want the insurance company to pay us 20.

Here the insurance company is the derivative called PUT option.

We want to buy insure so we will have to paya premium and the policy has to be renewed at a certain date. The premium let us assume is 1%, i.e. 200 amountfor insurance of our 200 shares.

We pay the insurance company: 200 as premium to protect our share value.

Lets take a look at what can happen over a few months:

**Month 1:**  
Opening stock price/Purchase price: 100  
Insured amount: 80% of stock value i.e. 100 x 200 x 80/100 = 16000  
Insurance premium: 1% i.e. 100 x 200 x 1/100 = 200  
stock price at the end of 1st month: 90  
Insurance is up for renewal.The insurance premium is kept by the insurance company.  
We can assume the Insurance premium as a cost: -200 for the month.

**Month 2:**  
Opening stock price for the month: 90  
Insurance premium: 1.5% i.e. 100 x 200 x 1.5/100 = 300  
Insured amount: 80% of stock purchase value i.e. 100 x 200 x 80/100 = 16000  
stock price at the end of 1st month: 85  
Insurance is up for renewal.The insurance premium is kept by the insurance company.  
We can assume the Insurance premium as a cost: -300 for the month.

**Month 3: case 1**  
Opening stock price for the month: 85  
Insurance premium: 2% i.e. 100 x 200 x 2/100 = 400  
Insured amount: 80% of stock purchase value i.e. 100 x 200 x 80/100 = 16000  
stock price at the end of 1st month: 65  
Insurance pays us, because stock value has suffered a loss: 15 per share i.e. 15 x 200 = 3000  
Insurance has been claimed and we need to renew for the next month.  
The insurance company had to pay us in this month, amount received: +3000

**Month 3: Case 2**  
Opening stock price for the month: 85  
Insurance premium: 2% i.e. 100 x 200 x 2/100 = 400  
Insured amount: 80% of stock purchase value i.e. 100 x 200 x 80/100 = 16000  
stock price at the end of month: 110  
Insurance is up for renewal.The insurance premium is kept by the insurance company.  
We can assume the Insurance premium as a cost: -400 for the month.

**Month 3: Case 3**
Opening stock price for the month: 85  
Insurance premium: 2% i.e. 100 x 200 x 2/100 = 400  
Insured amount: 80% of stock purchase value i.e. 100 x 200 x 80/100 = 16000  
stock price at the end of month: 130  
Insurance is up for renewal.The insurance premium is kept by the insurance company.  
We can assume the Insurance premium as a cost: -400 for the month.

As you can see, more often than not getting insurance for your stocks is prudent.

## Collar Strategy

A collar strategy aims to reduce the premium paid for insurance of stocks to very low while keeping the opportunity for profits(limited).   
Collar strategy in technical terms, we will follow it up with a no jargon explanation:  
A collar strategy is selling a call and buying a put on an underlying asset to protect value while paying/recieveing a small amount.

That is way too complicated for me. I understand this simply as:  
If you own a house and want to protect your investmentyou can buy house insurance. As with all insurance you need to pay a premium. Detailed explanation in part 1 linked at the top.  

At the same time, you can also earn rent from your house. Detailed explanation: click here  
Earning rent from the house is a strategy where we agree to give our shares to a buyer at an agreed price(Strike Price) till a certain date(expiry date). If on the agreed date the share price is higher than the agreed price.  
The buyer give us a rent(premium) to have the opportunity of owning the stock at the agreed price if price goes above the agreed price on the agreed date.  
If you take rent and pay insurance premium, then there is a chance that the premium can be paid partially or fully by the rent. The appreciation in house value will go to you but partially.  

Subsitute stock/share in the statements above and that is a collar strategy.

***The insurance is called buying a PUT option.***  
***The rent is called writing/selling a CALL option.***  

You are not allowed to rent or insure a room in the house. You can only insure or rent the entire house. The house in case of stocks is called a lot. Which is a set number of shares that can be either insured or rented.

Lets take a look at what can happen over a few months:

***Month 1:***  
Investment:  
Opening stock price/Purchase price: 1,000

Lot: 200 Shares

Invested Amount: 1,000 x 200 = 200,000

Insurance:(Buy Put)

Strike Price: 80
(If price of share is below 80 at the end of the month we will get (80 – end of month share price) * lot)

Amount Invested: 1,000 x 200 = 200,000

Insured amount: 80% of stock value i.e. 1000 x 200 x 80/100 = 160,000

Insurance premium paid: 1% i.e. 1,000 x 200 x 1/100 = 2000

Our insurance expires at the end of the month.

Rent:(Sell Call aka Write Call)<

Agreed price(Strike Price): 110

This is the price at which the person paying rent will buy the shares, if price at the end of the month is above 110.

Rent received: 2% of stock value i.e. 1,000 x 200 x 2/100 = 4000

We keep the rent and shares if price is below 110 at end of the month.

What happens at the end of the month:

**Case 1:**

Share price remains same as start of the month

Investment value: Same as starting i.e. 200,000

Other amount: Rent recieved – Insurance premium paid = 4000-2000 = +2000

Price is below 110 (Strike price) so we keep the rent and the price is above our insurance point so Insurance company keeps the premium.

**Case 2:**    
Price is between 100 and 110, let us assume 105.

Investment value: Increased by (Current Price – Purchase Price) x number of shares = (105-100) x 200 = +1000

Other amount: Rent recieved – Insurance premium paid = 4000-2000 = +2000

Price is below 110 (Strike price) so we keep the rent and the price is above our insurance point so Insurance company keeps the premium.

**Case 3:**  
Price is above 110, let us assume 140.

Investment value: Increased by (Rent Strike Price – Purchase Price) x number of shares = (110-100) x 200 = +2000

We have to sell/give our shares to the person who paid us rent as the agreed strike price is crossed. So our selling price is 110.

Other amount: Rent recieved – Insurance premium paid = 4000-2000 = +2000

**Case 4:**  
Price is below 80, let us assume 50.

Investment value: Decreased by (Current Price – Purchase Price) x number of shares = (50-100) x 200 = -10000

We insured our investment at 80 strike price. Now that the price is below 80 the insurance company will have to pay us.

Insurance pays us: (Insurance Strike Price – Current Price) x number of shares = (80-50) x 200 = +6000

Other amount: Rent recieved – Insurance premium paid = 4000-2000 = +2000

Price is below 110 (Strike price) so we keep the rent.

Total in Case 4 = Investment value decrease + Insurance payment received + Other amount = -10,000 + 6000 + 2000 = -2000

-2000 is a 20% loss.

What happens if we didn’t have insurance and rent? (Current Price – Purchase Price) x number of shares = (50 – 100) x 200 = -5000 that is a 50% loss

Even though our investment pick was wrong we are still in a much better position with the collar strategy. If the case 1, 2 had been true for even 2-3 months before the loss in case 4, we would be net positive.

Note: chances of getting trades such as the ones used in the example are low/non-existant. We merely want to get clear on the concept.
