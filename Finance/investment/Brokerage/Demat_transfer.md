Demat accounts are managed by National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) and Central Depository Services Limited (CDSL) in India. The question that comes to mind is whether or not we can move our Demat account.

### How to Transfer a Demat Account From One Broker to Another?

The broker determines the mode of account transfer. Some of them give a manual or offline procedure, while the remainder do so online.

Do you solely trade with CDSL? You have the option to make a Demat account transfer online.

1. Go to the CDSL website and click the 'Register Online' option to register.

2. Complete the form with the required information.

3. Select the option to print the form from the drop-down menu.

4. The Demat Account is transferred to the Depository Participant.

5. After the depository participant has completed the verification, you will receive a password to your registered email address.

6. Log in with this password and transfer the desired shares.

### Offline Demat Account Transfer
The Manual Demat Account Transfer is used when your existing broker and the new broker are both affiliated with different depositories. This information must be entered into the DIS (Debit Instruction Slip) by the trader.

1. Make a list of the stocks you want to sell.

2. Make a note of the ISIN, a 12-digit number that aids in the identification of securities such as equities, bonds, and stocks.

3. Verify that the ISIN is correct, as it will be used to process the transaction.

4. Make a mental note of the Target Client ID.

5. Choose the appropriate transfer method: Off Market Transfer or Inter Depository Transfer.

6. Make sure you mark the correct option.

7. After the DIS is completed, you must send it to your current broker. In return, you'll get an acknowledgment slip.

### Demat Account Transfer Form

As previously stated, Demat account transfers can be completed online or offline.

The form is available in the broker's office for offline Demat account transfers, while the Demat account transfer form is available on CDSL's website for online Demat account transfers.
