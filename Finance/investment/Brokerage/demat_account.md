### DMAT Account
A Demat account works a lot like a savings bank account. In the same way, we use more than one savings account to save and invest our money, multiple Demat accounts help us to diversify our investments by storing money in different accounts. In case you hold different kinds of assets, you can store them in segregated Demat accounts, making your investments more organised. Every Demat account is linked with a PAN card; hence, every equity/asset that you invest in will be considered as your investment as it's linked to your PAN card. Another thing to note is that you can open one Demat account with one broker. If you wish to open a second Demat account, you would have to approach a second broker. When you ask the question, “how many Demat accounts can I open?”, you may do so without thinking of the fact that you have to deal with different brokerages. 


Advantages of Multiple Demat Accounts:   
1. Portfolio Segregation: Having more than one Demat account can help you segregate your portfolio efficiently. You can maintain separate trading and investment portfolios; for instance, long-term investments & short-term/frequent trading in different Demat accounts. If you consider the fact that some people invest in many investment products, several accounts help keep these categories more organised, and investors are not prone to get confused. They are also able to keep a track of different assets in varying Demat accounts. This enables investors to monitor assets and rebalance portfolios with convenience and ease. 

2. Research and Analysis from Different Brokers: Having multiple Demat accounts will also give you multiple perspectives on buying and selling stocks. This can be in the form of research and access from multiple stockbrokers, or even the user interfaces used by brokerage companies.

3. Safety: Your securities are secure in electronic form in your trading accounts.

4. Widen Your Portfolio: You can widen your portfolio by adding Demat accounts along the way. This move will also go a long way in enhancing your reputation in the market. For instance, if you want to invest in an IPO down the road, a diversified portfolio fueled by multiple Demat accounts can be the golden ticket. This is true even for government securities. 

Disadvantages of Multiple Demat Accounts:    
1. Opening Demat accounts multiple times will invite additional changes like annual maintenance charges and others. This will, hence, increase your overall trading expenses. Can we have multiple Demat accounts but avoid heavy charges? If you want to save as much as possible, you can have more than a single Demat account, but consider the charges of each brokerage that you sign up with. While one brokerage may charge you hefty fees, another may not. 

2. Keeping track of multiple Demat accounts can be tricky as each broker offers access to trading platforms which can be confusing to figure out.

3. In the event that your Demat account remains inactive for a specific period of time, your broker may freeze your account. Although your stocks can be recovered, the process may be described as a hassle.
