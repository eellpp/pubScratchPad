### Choosing the best stock broker 
https://financialhorse.com/best-stock-broker-2020/  

If youâ€™re a new investor, I know all this is a lot to take in. But if I had to do it all again, I would just open 2 brokerage accounts: DBS Vickers Cash Upfront for Singapore stocks, and Saxo Markets for foreign stocks.
Hand over my heart, I truly think that this combination is the most suitable for most retail investors out there.
