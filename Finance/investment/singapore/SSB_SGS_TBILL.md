SSB:  
https://www.mas.gov.sg/bonds-and-bills/Singapore-Savings-Bonds


### Difference between SSB and SGS

The unique selling point about the SSB is its flexibility. Unlike conventional bonds where investors receive the short end of the stick if they redeem the bonds early, the SSB has no lock-in restrictions.

 SSB is that the returns are tax-exempted

Interest rates on the SSB will be linked to long-term SGS rates.

This means that the average interest you receive over the period you hold the SSB will match what you would have received had you bought an SGS bond of equivalent tenor.

The key difference is, while SGS bonds pay the same interest every year, the SSB offer “step-up” rates, meaning that interest payment will increase the longer you hold your bonds.

### Are SSB rates good   
SSB's are lower than that of long-term CPF funds, but at least they’re higher than that of short-term fixed deposits and savings accounts.

If you’re looking for somewhere to park your savings (under $100,000), forget about the banks and go for the SSB instead. 


**What is TBILL**.  
T-bills (Treasury bills) are with short maturities of only six months or one year and the same backing of the Singapore Government with an “AAA” credit rating!
They are an alternative if you are not so keen on parking your cash for 10 years in the Singapore Savings Bond (SSB) or Singapore Government Securities (SGS) bonds for the full tenor.  

**Difference between TBILL and SGS**.  
Unlike SGS bonds, however, you are not paid with coupons. Instead, you buy T-bills at a discount to the face (par) value and are given the full value at maturity.

In other words, if I were to buy a 6-months T-bill worth $10,000 with a yield of 3 per cent p.a., I would only need to pay $9,850 upfront.

At the end of the tenor, I will receive the full $10,000 worth and would have earned $150.

**How Do I Withdraw Money ?**.  
SSB:
Redeem the full principal with accrued interest through Online Bank or ATM. 
There will be no penalty for early withdrawal. 


SGS: 
no Early redemption

TBILL:   
Investors are `NOT` able to redeem T-bills early. However, you may choose to sell your T-bill on the secondary market at DBS, OCBC, or UOB’s main branches.

That said, the price of the T-bill may rise or fall before maturity and the trading volume for T-bills is low, making them rather illiquid. So be sure that you are okay with locking up your money for the duration of the tenor!
