### What exactly is the CPF Retirement Sum
When you turn 55, your Ordinary Account and Special Account will merge to form your Retirement Account. You will be allowed to withdraw any excess money, but are obliged to leave behind the Retirement Sum in your account.  

CPF does, however, publish estimated Retirement Sum payouts, computed based on the CPF LIFE standard plan.  
Age 55 in 2020 to 2022 will need 90K to 96K in CPF for the Basic Retirement Sum. These will be payed out monthly from age 65
