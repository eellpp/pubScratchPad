Custodian Account
A custodian account is an account, administered by a financial institution, that holds securities investments on our behalf. These financial institutions tend to be large and reputable firms that we trust to safeguard our investments.

Most commonly, we may come across custodian accounts when we invest in stocks. This is because most of the brokerage firms in Singapore offer their own custodian accounts, with more competitive trading fees and charges, for us to store our investments with them.

For overseas-listed stocks and on regular shares savings (RSS) plans, we generally need to store our investments in a custodian account with the brokerage firms. Our brokerage firms, if it is a CDP Approved Depository Agents, would typically also maintain a sub-account with CDP on our behalf.

1) Interactive Brokers only offers a custodian account, which means that we will store our investments with Interactive Brokers rather than in our CDP Account after buying stocks. Thereâ€™s virtually no charge for holding our investments this way, IBKR does not charge any custodian account fees.

### CDP Account
Central Depository (CDP) Account
The Central Depository (CDP) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Singapore Exchange (SGX) that provides integrated clearing, settlement and depository services for a wide range of investments in the Singapore Securities Market.

The Central Depository Account, or commonly known as CDP, is an account to safe keep all the shares you bought through the open market. Operated by the Singapore Stock Exchange (SGX), a CDP acts as a safe for all your stocks. Stocks and bonds that one buys on the SGX are deposited into his/her personal CDP account.  

When we invest in SGX-listed companies, exchange traded funds (ETFs), bonds and other securities, we can store them in our CDP account. Of course, to do this, we also need to have a brokerage account to buy and sell the investments.  

We can also store our Singapore Government Securities (SGS), including SGS bonds, Treasury bills (T-bills) and the Singapore Savings Bonds (SSBs) in our CDP accounts.

SGS bonds are listed on the SGX after its initial issuance, which means we can buy and sell it on the secondary market, with a brokerage account. T-bills, while also stored in our CDP accounts, can only be bought and sold on the secondary market via the three local banks (but not via brokerage accounts). Lastly, our SSB investments cannot be bought or sold, but can be redeemed, are also stored in our CDP accounts.

#### How to Choose an Online Brokerage Platform
Finding the best online trading platform that fits your needs is crucial to becoming a successful investor. You should consider the following features and requirements before picking an online broker in Singapore.

1. Brokerage Fees and Minimum Funding
Brokerage fees are one of the most important factors when choosing a trading platform. Active traders should look for a firm with the lowest commission rates in markets they invest in most frequently. Investors who make fewer, larger investments should prioritise finding a platform with a low, flat fee per trade.

Commission: This is the most common and upfront fee traders should expect to pay. Think of it as a service charge that the online brokerage charges every time you want to execute a trade. The more frequent you trade the more fees you will pay. If you are a long-term trader and you expect to have low trade volume, then commission fees may not be your highest concern when shopping for a brokerage.

You should also consider the minimum funding requirements of different brokerage accounts to find one that fits your budget. Some trading platforms like Saxo Markets have different account tiers depending on the size of your total investment.

2. Market Access
Another crucial factor when selecting a brokerage account is market access. While amateur investors may be content with access to a few markets, experienced traders may seek access to stocks and ETFs in dozens of countries. If you are interested in trading CFDs, gold, crypto, or Forex, make sure you find a brokerage that offers these products. Trading platforms that offer advanced trading products and broad international access tend to have higher fees.

3. Usability and Quality of the Brokerage App
Make sure to explore the interface of different brokerage platforms and see which devices are supported. You want to use a platform that you can easily understand and have access to your finances from a desktop and mobile device.

4. Educational Materials and Customer Support
Many brokerage firms offer research materials, informative visuals, and live stock quotes that can be helpful for making informed investments, especially for beginner traders. You should also make sure the brokerage firm you select has a responsive customer support and security features to protect your account from fraudulent activity.

5. Automated Features and Advanced Tools
AI and technological advances are making it easier than ever to invest. Brokerage platforms like Interactive Brokers offer algorithmic trading which allows consumers to speed up execution, improve pricing, and time the market with ease. You can also leverage robo advisors to help you set goals and manage your trades.
