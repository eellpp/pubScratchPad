### MF performance @Aug 2020
The mutual fund industry (as measured by the Nifty) has delivered a compounded annual return of around 9% over the past decade, 7% over the past 5 years and about 5% over the past 3 years.   
Large-cap mutual funds have delivered an annual return of just 8.36%, on average, over the past decade, according to data from Value Research. Their mid- and small-cap peers have delivered 9-11%, which is only a short distance away from the 8% that was offered on bank fixed deposits (FDs) and public provident fund (PPF) at the start of the decade. The problem becomes more acute if we look at more recent 3- and 5-year returns.  

The SPIVA report for December 2019 compiled by S&P Dow Jones showed that only 35% of large-cap funds managed to beat their benchmark indices over the last 10 years.  

Much of the debt fund story thus depends on whether the prevailing tax advantage over bank FDs will continue. Long Term Capital Gains (LTCG) on debt funds are taxed at 20% and given the benefit of indexation, while FD interest is taxed at slab rates.  

**Investment products sold as insurance policies such as Unit Linked Insurance Policies (ULIPs).**  
The commissions on insurance policies are significantly higher than mutual funds despite a gradual clampdown on them by the insurance regulator, IRDAI. The insurance industry also enjoys the advantage of zero tax on returns for policies which meet certain criteria, which even equity mutual funds cannot match. This is because Budget 2018 levied a 10% LTCG on hitherto tax-free equity mutual fund returns while leaving insurance untouched.
