Index funds are passively managed and there is hardly any difference between one fund and another. To maximise your returns, go with the lowest expense ratio fund.  

Over the last couple of years, many investors have increased exposure to index funds as returns from several categories of actively-managed funds failed to beat the Nifty 50 returns. In the past one year, the Nifty 50 has returned 12.51% (Jul 2019)

Buffet on index funds: Mutual funds, especially low-cost index funds, are the best investment type for most investors wanting to outperform the average managed portfolio in the long run. Buffett mentioned Vanguard funds in a big way. Specifically, he recommended that the cash left to his wife be invested 10% in short-term government bonds and 90% in a very low-cost S&P 500 index fund.

A stock with high index-weight has more liquidity and low impact cost. This is why stocks like HDFC Bank can be found even in small cap funds. It is almost a substitute for cash and in and outflows can be handled well.


### Argument Against Index Fund
Take the NIfty 50 index. It has 50 stocks and that sounds like a lot, but just ten of then make 62.7% of the total weight.  In the case of the Sensex, it is 71.11%. Even in the case of the S&P 500 the top 10 accounts for 27.1% of the total weight (all nos as of June 2020).  

Something is true with index funds that was less true historically, which is the concentration of a few large companies in the largest indexes - as in, the amount of percentage of capital they have. Fact, FAANG make up 10% of the s&p 500 index, tech makes up 20+ %. It's NOT at all averaged out in the way the Bogleheads might think it is. Is it a "bet on the economy," or is it a bet on the stocks of big tech? (July 2020)

#### Index Correction is slow 
 If any of the big names get into trouble – fraud, insider trading etc – then the index could correct sharply. It may take months before such stocks are weeded out of the index.
