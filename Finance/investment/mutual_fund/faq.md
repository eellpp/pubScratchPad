You should factor in many details like past performance, AUM size, alpha, beta, etc while investing in a mutual fund. But NAV shouldn’t be looked at.  

### Exit Load
Exit load is a cost that an investor needs to bear if he or she sells the mutual fund units before a predefined time frame. Typically, equity mutual fund schemes levy an exit load of 1% if the units are sold within one year of buying. Simply put, it is a mechanism to deter investors from premature withdrawals

### Expense Ratio
An expense ratio is an annual fee expressed as a percentage of your investment — or, like the term implies, the ratio of your investment that goes toward the fund's expenses. If you invest in a mutual fund with a 1% expense ratio, you'll pay the fund $10 per year for every $1,000 invested.  

If you invest Rs 10,000 in a fund which has an expense ratio of 2%, then it means that you need to pay Rs 200 to the fund in order to manage your money. Simply put, if a fund earns returns equal to 15% and has an expense ratio of 2%, then you would earn a return equal to 13%.

Since the expense ratio is charged on a regular basis, a high expense ratio over the long term may significantly eat into your returns as a result of the power of compounding. For example, Rs 1 lakh over 10 years at the rate of 15 per cent will grow to Rs 4.05 lakh. But if we consider an expense ratio of 1.5 per cent, your actual total returns would be Rs 3.55 lakh, nearly 14 per cent less than what it would have been without any expense charge.
