### Capital Gain Tax
The basic tax rates for investments in MFs are the same, whether you are an NRI or an ordinary Indian citizen. A quick recap: withdrawals after a year attract long-term capital gains tax, withdrawals in less than a year are subject to short-term capital gains tax. Long-term capital gains tax on equity funds is nil. Short-term capital gains tax on equity funds is 15.45% (15% base rate and 3% cess). Long-term capital gains tax on debt funds is 10.30% (10% base rate and 3% cess) without indexation benefits or 20.6% (20% base rate and 3% cess) with indexation benefits. Short-term capital gains tax is as per your tax bracket.

### TDS Deduction
NRI withdrawals are subject to tax deducted at source (TDS).   
There is no TDS if you withdraw from equity funds after a year, but if you withdraw from equity funds within a year, you pay a TDS of 15%. If you withdraw from your debt funds after a year, a TDS of 20% (after indexation benefits) gets deducted; short-term withdrawals attract a TDS of 30%.  

If your income is below the taxable limit, you are entitled to a refund.  
Every fund house dispatches TDS certificates once every quarter. Earlier they used to dispatch every month. In other words, your fund house sends TDS certificates, typically, after March, June, September and December. This means if you withdraw from your fund house in April, you will get your TDS certificate after June (the immediate quarter-end that follows after your withdrawal).  

### No Long Term Capital Gain Tax for NRI
Although NRIs, just like ordinary (those residing in India) citizens, are allowed the basic exemption limits, they cannot take its benefit when it comes to long-term capital gains tax, unlike ordinary citizens. For instance, the basic exemption limit for an Indian citizen (other than someone who’s aged 60 years or above and those who are aged 80 years or above) is 2 lakh. Any income up to 2 lakh is exempt from tax. So if your capital gains from the sale of MFs come up to, say, 50,000, you don’t pay any tax because your gains fall under the basic exemption limit of 2 lakh. However, if you are an NRI, you will be liable to pay tax (which may have been deducted by way of TDS), notwithstanding the fact that your income is less than 2 lakh.
