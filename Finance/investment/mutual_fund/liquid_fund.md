Liquid funds are debt funds that invest in short-term fixed-interest generating money market instruments. These can be treasury bills, commercial paper, and so on, which mature within 91 days.  

Historically, liquid funds have been found to generate profits in the range of 7% to 9%. It is way higher than the mere 4% returns obtained on a savings bank account. Even though the returns on liquid funds are not guaranteed, more often than not, they have delivered positive returns upon redemption.

The allocated proportions are as per the fundâ€™s investment objective. The fund manager will ensure that the average maturity of the portfolio is three months.
