After an asset management company launches New Fund Offer (NFO), an investor buys units of the fund at a specific price. No new investor can enter the fund after the NFO period is over. Also, investors are not allowed to exit the fund before the maturity of the scheme.  The maturity period typically ranges from 3-4 years.

Investors who want to exit the fund before maturity, can trade their units on stock exchanges. Closed end funds’ units are traded on stock exchanges just like any other public security. The price of the units vary according to market fluctuations and performance of the concerned investment portfolio of the scheme.

### Lack of past records and real time comparison
Close-ended mutual funds do not have any track record and aren’t open to investors after their initial offer period. Most agencies do not rank them in their rating exercises. Lack of a track record implies that past performance cannot be reviewed or scrutinised. Such schemes can neither be compared with their peer schemes and benchmarks, nor can their performance be tracked or compared real time. Moreover, sporadic disclosures also make analysis of close-ended funds difficult and lack of scrutiny often leads to complacency for close-ended fund managers.  

### No redemption pressure
With a closed-ended fund, the fund manager has the advantage of managing the money pooled without any redemption pressure during the lock-in period. 

Since close-ended funds require lump sum investment, investors should invest small sums in different schemes of close-ended funds, instead of putting the lump sum into a single scheme. Ideally, investor should invest 5-10 percent of the desired corpus amount in each close-ended scheme


### Agent commision
With the closed-end fund, the fund house could pass on 3-5 years of trail commissions in the first year, allowing agents to hard sell these products.  

### Do not buy equity linked close end funds
The only suggestion to investors around closed-end funds is this: do not buy any equity closed-end funds. There are stories of poorly performing stocks being dumped from open-ended into closed-end funds of the same fund house. Because once in, the investor cannot exit except on the secondary market. That is not a viable option due to the big discount closed-end funds trade at.
