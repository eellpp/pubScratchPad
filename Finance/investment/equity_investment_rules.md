### Pension Contribution to equity : 100 - age %
 How much of my pension contribution each month should be invested in shares?  
The universal rule of thumb here is that the amount you should invest in shares as part of your pension portfolio should be equal to 100 minus your current age. So, if you are 40 years old, the % of your pension fund invested in shares should be 60%.
