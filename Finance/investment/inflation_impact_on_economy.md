Rising inflation has an insidious effect: input prices are higher, consumers can purchase fewer goods, revenues, and profits decline, and the economy slows for a time until a measure of economic equilibrium is reached.  
Value stocks perform better in high inflation periods and growth stocks perform better during low inflation.  
When inflation is on the upswing, income-oriented or high-dividend-paying stock prices generally decline.  
Stocks overall do seem to be more volatile during highly inflationary periods.  

High inflation can be good, as it can stimulate some job growth. But high inflation can also impact corporate profits through higher input costs.7﻿ This causes corporations to worry about the future and stop hiring, reducing the standard of living of individuals, especially those on fixed incomes.  

Greater volatility of stock movements was correlated with higher inflation rates  
 
Since the 1930s, the research suggests that almost every country suffered its worst real returns during high inflation periods.  
 
One way investors can predict expected inflation is to analyze the commodity markets, although the tendency is to think that if commodity prices are rising, stocks should rise since companies “produce” commodities. However, high commodity prices often squeeze profits, which in turn reduces stock returns. Therefore, following the commodity market may provide insight into future inflation rates
