### Taking loan when interest rates are high and selling it off in low interest rate regime
Mortgage loan rates are associated with treasury rate. Generally 2 to 3 % or more than Gov risk free rate.  
When rates are high, there is generally lot inflation in economy and rates are high to bring them down.  
Investors don't want to take big loans and everyone want to have cash to invest into risk free bonds.  
The house prices in these scenarios are falling.  

If one has sufficient cash reserve to buy house in high interest rate regime, and hold on for the tide to turn then  
over time the economy cools down and rates go down. Which pushes money back to real estate as the returns become better.  
The house prices start increasing.  
Selling the real estate at low interest rates then creates a handsome profit
