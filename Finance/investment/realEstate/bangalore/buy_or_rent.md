Apartments should be purchased as places to stay and probably not as long term (> 20 years) investment options

### When to buy
If you can pay for it in cash and get rid of it in a couple of years to buy another one then it makes sense in terms of resale value.

### Resale value of apartment is good when

- If the location is very good (near to offices or good schools / colleges)
- If the builder is well known
- If the community and the facilities provided are good
- If the apartment is not very old (<5â€“6 years)


### Resale Value Calculations
Let's assume you buy a flat worth 70 lakhs.

You break all savings and investments put 20 lakhs upfront as down payment and take a loan of 50 lakhs at an interest rate of 8.5% for 20 years.

This works out to an EMI of 43391 per month for the next 20 years.

You pay a total of 1,04,13,879 for the loan of 50 lakhs that makes you total cost of purchasing the home 1,24,13,879. Where the interest alone is 54,13,879 !

20 years later

1,24,13,879 - This is what a 20 year old apartment has cost you.

Let's assume that property prices will continue to increase and the economy does well for 20 years and there is no crash in property prices, in this scenario assuming a modest increase in value of 5% every year the apartment should be worth 1,85,73,084 theoretically

That would give you a profit of 61,59,205 lakhs

But tell me this, currently in Bangalore is there any 20 year old apartment that you would pay 1.85 cr for ?

Forget 20, let's look at even a 10 year old apartment and someone demanding 1.85 cr for it. And do note that this is not some posh upscale luxury apartment in an amazing place. This would be a decent and middle class apartment which can possibly be 3bhk.

To me, it does not make sense to buy an apartment with a loan, be bound to it for 2 decades and then close to retirement be unsure and without potential for maximising gains by selling.
