- plot with corporation water
- BDA approved layouts


BWSSB takes care of supplying water to bangalore cit. 80% of the water coming from the Cauvery River. Remanining water is also drawn from the Arkavathy River, but the supply does not meet the demand. Arkavathy River has two reservoirs built on the river, the Hesaraghatta (or Hesseraggatta) which was built in 1894 and the Tippagondanahalli Reservoir (or T G Halli), which was built in 1933.

I have heard that South and West Bangalore (with some old residential areas) usually get regular supply for water. So, if you are looking for regular Cauvery water supply, you should look at these areas (only problem is that rentals and property prices are very high in those areas).

### BDA Layout vs BDA Approved Layout
BDA layout means layouts which are formed by Bangalore Development Authority by acquiring the land from the land owners under section 4(1) and 6(1) of Land acquisition Act. Once property acquired By BDA all individual rights will go and state will be the owner all such properties. Upon the formation of layout BDA will in turn allot to the applicants on seniority and some others site under various schemes.


BDA approved Layouts means , if any builder Or Individual OR Society intend to form layout, after securing the land ,after converting for residential pupose from the GOVt, the same may approach BDA for approval of layout plan .The BDA after satisfying about the Roads and civil amenities in the layout will release 60% sites and after development 40% will be released. On the other had there are in the instances where BDA allotted lands to some Societies Like BDA employees society, Judicial employees society .Though lands are acquired by BDA those layouts cannot be considered as BDA layout, but they are only BDA approved layouts.
