#### Five property lessons from my early years in Singapore
https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2018/07/05/five-property-lessons-from-my-early-years-in-singapore/

The writer, a women, came to singapore in 1998, earning 4k salary and started buying resale properties, when the market was down , after the dotcom bust. She started with something she could afford, a single room condo and rented it out, the rent of which financed the mortgage of her second property. Meanwhile she continued to stay on rent ($500) while rent out the property at $1800. 

> I resisted the temptation to move into my first property and rented it out at S$1,800 a month, using my CPF to pay for the mortgage. After the outgoing expenses, the cashflow was enough to cover my room’s rent at S$550. I saved up the rest every month and was soon ready to buy my second property the following year in 2003 and the third one the third year.

##### Property lesson #3: Don’t end up “subsidizing” your tenants. 
> A year after I came to Singapore, I rented a private apartment with two flatmates. The last tenant was paying S$2,500 a month while we were renting at S$1,800, and S$1,600 or S$1,500 in subsequent contract renewals. The landlord’s rental return had fallen 28 to 40 percent in four years’ time.
> The loan instalment was S$2,500, on top of the management fee, property tax and other repair costs. We were basically being “subsidized” by the landlord to stay there. After we moved out, the place was left vacant for a few years.
> The landlord bought the place near the market peak at S$850,000 for its en bloc potential. It was finally sold in a collective sale for over a million. I don’t think he made much from the deal.

“If you are doing what the average person is doing, your result will only be average. If you don’t want to end up a mediocre, you must have the courage to do something different.”

“Experienced investors don’t ask around for opinions and they don’t need reassurance from others. After all, they make money not from following the path of the crowd, but from deviating from the course of the crowd.”

“ To buy when others are despondently selling and to sell when others are avidly buying requires the greatest fortitude and pays the greatest ultimate rewards.  – Lauren Templeton and Scott Phillips, Investing the Templeton Way
