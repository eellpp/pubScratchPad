### Short-term Capital Gains
When you sell a property within three years of purchasing the same, the gain arising from the sale is classified as a short-term capital gain. In the case of NRIs, short-term capital gains are taxed as per the Income Tax slab of the NRI. The short-term capital gain on which you need to calculate tax will be the cost of the sale minus the cost of purchase.

### Long-term Capital Gains
When you sell a property three years after purchasing it, the gain arising from the sale is classified as a long-term capital gain. In the case of NRIs, long-term capital gains are taxed at 20% with indexation benefit. The long-term capital gain on which you need to calculate tax will be the cost of the sale minus the cost of the indexed value. Letâ€™s take an example.

Suppose you purchased a property in 2000 for Rs. 30 lakhs and are selling it in 2016 for Rs. 90 lakhs. The Cost of Inflation Index for the year 2000 is 406 while for 2016 it is 1125. So the indexed cost of your property will be 1125/406 * 30,00,000 = Rs. 83.13 lakhs. Therefore your capital gain will be Rs. 6.87 lakhs and the capital gains tax will be Rs. 1.37 lakhs. For inherited property, the date of purchase will be the same as the one on which the property was purchased by the original owner. The same is the case for the purchase value, that is, the cost the original owner paid for the property will be taken as the cost of purchase.

### Is TDS applicable?
Yes. Unlike Resident Indians, NRIs need to pay TDS on the capital gains they make in India. For short-term capital gains, the TDS will be 30% while it is 20% for long-term capital gains. This is regardless of your tax slab.  

### Exemption
Capital gains from the sale of a house property may be claimed as exempt from tax when they are invested for the purchase or construction of another house property. This exemption has been laid down under Section 54 of the Income-tax Act. The benefits of this section are also available to NRIs. To be able to claim this exemption, you are required to invest your capital gains. If the entire capital gains earned are not invested, the balance uninvested capital gains shall be taxable at 20% after allowing for indexation of the cost of acquisition. Therefore, there is no restriction on how much you can invest. Also, there is no requirement to invest the entire sales proceeds under this section. But do note that any capital gains that remain uninvested shall be taxed at 20% after allowing for indexation.
