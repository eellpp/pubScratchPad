“The first home may not be the one you want the most. But at least you get on the property ladder and then you slowly climb up.”

### 3-3-5 rule for house buying
Following the ‘3-3-5’ means you meet all of the following criteria: 

1. You should have 30% of your capital ready before you purchase your property
2. Your monthly repayments should not be more than ⅓ of your monthly income 
3. And the property price should not exceed your annual income by 5x (adjusted by age)

age-group | ratio
---- | ----
30-40 | 5x
40-50 | 4x
50+ | 3x


### Follow the crowd
1. Find the average salary in your social group.  
2. Find the average house buying cost for this income group nationally/regionally.  

This is the price range you should be targeting to buy to avoid overspending.
