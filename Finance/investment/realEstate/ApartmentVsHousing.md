> It's common to talk about knocking down homes or building more homes or whatever. The thing is that for the most part, only non-residents actually want that (because for them the choice is between high density or not living there). If you own a decently sized family home with a garden you're just not going to give it up and move into a block of flats. It's a strict downgrade in every sense of the word, even if the square footage is the same.

You don't have to pay the maintainance fees

### Pros Apartments

> I like not having a front/back yard to maintain (I don't enjoy gardening). I like the views that you can only get from higher floors, especially city views. I've even come to rely on some of the conveniences, like having a mail room with someone that'll sign for packages while I'm away.

24/7 doorman means someone to sign for packages.

A community of people who presumably are in your socioeconomic class will be living with you. These are folks you can interact with and depending on your stage in life you may potentially do business with, befriend, start children’s play groups with, or even date/marry.

Big communities tend to have nice amenities that you’d only find in a country club all inclusive.

Maintenance of the high rise unit is often included in the fees or rent.

These communities tend to get better access to interconnect technologies like fiber.

There will tend to be more options for healthy foods, increased opportunities for walkable restaurants and other forms of entertainment as the population density of the area increases.

For instance an appartment is easier to secure, maintenance fees can be split, commodity fees can also be split which makes it very affordable to have good infra (high speed internet, central heating, automatic post boxes etc), concierge services become an option. Then superb views, lack of surrounding noise, clean air are advantages on the higher floors.
