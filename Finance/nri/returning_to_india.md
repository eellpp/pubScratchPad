Assets outside India 

Continue to hold. You can hold, own, transfer or invest in foreign currency, foreign security or any immovable property situated outside India if such assets were acquired, held or owned by you when you were a non-resident or was inherited from a non-resident person.

Pro-tip: Be mindful of income tax regulations that determine scope of total income. You want to minimize tax paid in India on overseas assets and avoid double taxation. Plan your investments and date of return in the most tax efficient manner. 

Indian Assets


- Non-Resident Ordinary (NRO) a/c: To be re-designated to Resident a/c  
- Foreign Currency Non-Resident (FCNR) a/c: Permissible to hold up to maturity and then to be converted into Rupee Account or Resident Foreign Currency (RFC) a/c  
- Non-Resident External (NRE) a/c: To be re-designated to Resident a/c or balance can be transferred to RFC a/c*  
- Shares & Securities: Returning India is required to inform the Depository about change of his/her residential status from non-resident to resident  

Note that while NRE account and FCNR account here tax exempt while you were NRIs, they become taxable when you become Resident in India (even if you forget to re-designate them for whatever reason).   

A returning Indian who has been a NR as per the Act for 9 years or more or whose stay in India was less than 729 days in preceding 7 years, then generally for 2 successive years he may be considered as a RNOR.  

To maximize your NRI status, what date should you return to India?

It may not always be possible to plan your return to India. But for those with such flexibility, try to come back on or after February 1 (or February 2 in case of a leap year) of a FY in order to ensure NR status in the year of return.

Q: if you are an Nri and you have bought overseas property . Subsequently you return to India and become RNOR / Resident. Once you become RNOR / resident and sell the overseas property , would u get taxed on the transaction in India ?    
If you sell it when you're a Resident, it'll be taxable in India (as per the income tax act. DTAA position might be different based on the country where the property is).  
If you're an RNOR, the sale wouldn't be taxable in India.
