### Chewing food 32 times
One common piece of advice is to chew your food an estimated 32 times before swallowing. The goal of chewing is to break down your food so it loses texture. The 

Chewing 32 times appears to be an average number applied to most bites of food. Foods that are harder to chew, such as steak and nuts, may require up to 40 chews per mouthful. Foods like watermelon may require fewer chews to break down — as few as 10 to 15.  

Chewing almonds between 25 and 40 times not only suppressed hunger but also increased people’s ability to absorb nutrients from the almonds.  

**Digestion Begins in the Mouth**  
Saliva contains special enzymes that help digest the starches in your food. An enzyme called amylase breaks down starches (complex carbohydrates) into sugars, which your body can more easily absorb. Saliva also contains an enzyme called lingual lipase, which breaks down fats.  


### Don't drink water with meal
Drinking water can slow the digestive process by diluting enzymes in the body that break down food. This effect is especially intense if you suffer from digestive disorders such as gastroesophageal reflux disease.  
Drink water 30 minutes after meal.
