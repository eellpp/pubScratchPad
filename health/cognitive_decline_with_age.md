Other medical conditions and lifestyle factors have been linked to an increased risk of cognitive change, including:

- Diabetes
- Smoking
- High blood pressure
- Elevated cholesterol
- Obesity
- Depression
- Lack of physical exercise
- Low education level
- Infrequent participation in mentally or socially stimulating activities

You need physical, mental, and social stimulation.   
>> My grandmother is in her 90s and doing really well considering her age, and I can see that she walks, read books, and meets friends all the time.   

physical simulation: running, yoga, lifting weights, sports etc  
mental stimulation: learn to play musical instrument, learn new languages, painting, chess, games, puzzles, programming, reading books, etc.   
social stimulation: weekly social gathering, close friends with whom you can share feelings, doing group activities, calling up people etc  

### Social Isolation
Isolation is associated with an increased risk for dementia, although it's unclear how high the risk is    
Isolation is also associated with elevated risks for heart attack, stroke, chronic inflammation, depression, anxiety, perceived stress, and loneliness.  
People who feel lonely (disconnected from others) have been shown to have faster rates of cognitive decline than people who don't feel lonely. Loneliness is also tied to risks of losing the ability to take care of yourself and early death.Loneliness is a silent killer. Its so 'silent' that you won't even notice that you are declining but interestingly others will notice.   

>> My mum is a teaching assistant and is 71. She seems as sharp as ever and mood is the same. I think it's key that she still works full-time in a very social environment and keeps active outside of work. It's pretty clear to me that mental health declines rapidly once you start isolating and staying indoors all the time.

A decrease in stimulating mental activity that can come from social interaction



### Research
There were significant differences in cognitive function according to gender, and the differences were significant even when age was controlled, but gender differences disappeared when education was controlled. Age, education, social activities, number of comorbid diseases, and alcohol drinking affected cognitive function through interaction with gender, but interaction with gender disappeared when education was controlled. Regression analysis showed that depression, cohabitant, social activities etc., had a significant impact on both men and women under controlled education and age. In men, the effect of social activities was greater than that of women, and hyperlipidemia had the effect only in women.

The present study found that the overall cognitive function in urban Chinese older adults was normal and was greatly affected by age, educational level, marital status, occupational status, and exercise. There was an obvious aging effect on cognitive level, and cognitive function declined more rapidly after age 80. Cognitive function in the never-married older adults was lower. Older individuals used to be engaged in higher occupational cognitive requirements showed better cognitive levels. The protective effect of higher educational level and regular exercise on cognitive function could develop appropriate interventions to prevent and reduce cognitive aging.

Socioeconomic status, including older age, black ethnicity, lower income ratio, and lower education level, were associated with poorer neurocognitive function in all analyzed tests. In addition, participants with poor health, nonsmokers, and nondrinkers performed worse in all administered tests compared with individuals with good health, smokers, and participants consuming alcoholic beverages. Dietary and biochemical characteristics of the blood were not consistently associated with neurocognitive performance.
