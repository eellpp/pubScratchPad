 ### Why opioids have become attractive in modern society
 
The brain also makes its own “endogenous” opioids. These include endorphins and enkephalins that are better recognized for their roles in pleasure and pain, but are also critical to the formation and maintenance of social bonds. One 2004 study found that infant mice without certain opioid receptors did not show attachment to their mothers.  

Times of uncertainty and economic inequality tend to be associated with higher levels of opioid addiction. Some of the biggest risk factors for opioid overdose are social disconnection and using alone  

### connections between brain opioids and motherly love  
When people nurture children or fall in love, hormones like oxytocin are released, infusing memories of being together with endorphin-mediated feelings of calm, contentment and satisfaction. This is one way that social contact relieves stress, making bonding a fundamental protector of both mental and physical health. When we are far from our loved ones or sense that our relationships are threatened, we feel an anxiety that is not unlike withdrawal from drugs.  

Research showed that morphine, in doses so low that it didn’t cause sleepiness, eased separation cries made by baby animals in multiple species.  

When people experience an opioid high, they feel warmth, safety and love   

addiction to opiods is related to isolation  
A 2021 study found that over 60 percent of young American adults report that they are either frequently lonely or lonely nearly all the time.  

### Who are most vulnerable
People who experienced childhood trauma and neglect are at high risk for opioid addiction. People with mental illness or developmental disorders, which often bring isolation, are also highly susceptible. Low or falling socioeconomic status raises the risk for opioid use in part because it can erode social ties.


### The opposite of addiction isn’t abstinence. It’s love.
