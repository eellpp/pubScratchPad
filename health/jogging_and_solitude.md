There are many good reasons for walking and jogging: fitness, health, quiet solitude or conversation, and the stimulation that happenstance affords.  

Every day, once in the morning and again in the afternoon, Darwin strolled and reflected amongst the privet and hazel, often alongside his fox terrier. Darwin had a little pile of stones on the path, and he kicked one with each turn: some ideas were four-pebble problems.

Mind-wandering is what Charles Darwin did during his daily walks, walks that often ended with him so deep in thought that his children played tricks on him to test his concentration. Mind-wandering lets your conscious mind have a break, while allowing your subconscious to keep working, testing combinations, trying out scenarios, without your being aware of it. Mind-wandering isn't the opposite of focus. It's more like a complement to it. You need both to do good work, to be creative and productive, and to have a good life.

Novelist Haruki Murakami runs marathons. It is often written that the citizens of Königsberg set their clocks by the regular walks of philosopher Immanuel Kant. And Friedrich Nietzsche strolled for hours, often around lakes or up mountains. In Sorrento, Italy, he wandered to his Gedankenbaum – his "thought tree". 

### Non cognitive physical activities creates space for free thinking
Scientists speak of "transient hypofrontality": a state-of-mind promoted by pursuits that require physical exertion but little thought or concentration. The parts of the brain that coordinate general concepts and rules are turned down, while the motor and sensory parts are turned up. In this state, ideas and impressions mingle more freely. Unusual and unexpected thoughts arise.


Murakami, who believes jogging is important for his literary career. It gives the novelist not only strength and solitude, but also a certain liberty of mind. In What I Talk About When I Talk About Running, Murakami writes that he jogs to gain a "void": a mental blank, around which random thoughts come and go.
