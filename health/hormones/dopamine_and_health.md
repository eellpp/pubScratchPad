Dopamine is produced in brain and across body.  It functions both as hormone and neurotransmitter.

In brain its a neurotransmitter-a chemical messenger that sends information in between neurons.   
It is also produced in blood, kidney, guts and other parts.  
Dopamine does not cross the blood-brain barrier. So its synthesis and functions in peripheral areas are to a large degree independent of its synthesis and functions in the brain.   

Dopamine levels can affect a person's mood, attention, motivation, and movement. Dopamine also regulates the brain's reward system, with its levels increasing in the brain when a person experiences something pleasurable, such as eating food or having sex.  


### Action in brain
Dopamine is released by a neuron into the synapse (the small gap between two neurons), where it binds to specialized proteins called dopamine receptors on the neighboring neuron. By this process, dopamine acts as a chemical messenger, carrying a signal from neuron to neuron.  
More the dopamine released, more the intensity of pleasure.  

Dopamine brings about positive feelings based on a certain action. Serotonin is another neurotransmitter but it functions as mood stabilizer.  

Lack of dopamine production causes loosing control over body movements. Like parkinsons disease.  
Overdose of dopamine causes body to make too many movements.   
Slightest variation in the number of dopamine secretions in the prefrontal cortex area can severely impact one's memory.  
A lack of it in other parts can cause different signs, such as lack of motivation and desire.  

### Sex as natures reward system
Sexual intercourse sparks the release of dopamine, along with hormone and neurotransmitter oxytocin. These two things are what cause the euphoric feelings around sex and contribute to the human desire to engage in sexual intercourse. 

### Cocaine hacks the reward/response system by removing cleaner
Dopamine Transporter is a protein that removes dopamine from the synapse to be recycled for further use. Cocaine acts by binding to the dopamine transporter, blocking the removal of dopamine from the synapse. Dopamine then accumulates in the synapse to produce an amplified signal to the receiving neurons. This is what causes the euphoria commonly experienced immediately after taking the drug.  This includes hallucinations and delusions.  

Brain remembers this high pleasure associated with the drug and asks for more, causing addiction.  
Not only does someone become addicted, but they also will want to use higher amounts of the drug. The brain builds a tolerance to the drug and produces less dopamine when the person uses it, so they will have to use more and more of the drug to feel the same rush of dopamine as they did upon initial usage. Keep in mind that drugs can cause a release of two to ten times more dopamine than natural triggers like eating or sex.  

### Memory . We remember things that interest us
Dopamine can also explain why we best remember things that interest us. When something is interesting to us or excites us, we get a spike of dopamine because the experience of learning about that thing is pleasurable. The dopamine secretes in the prefrontal cortex, so our memory is activated, and we are more likely to remember whatever we're learning about. When we find the subject boring, we do not have the same dopamine spike, so there is less dopamine in the prefrontal cortex, and thus it is harder for us to remember what we learned.  

### Focus and Attention Deficit
Dopamine responds to the optic nerves (those used for vision) to help someone focus their attention on a specific activity. When visually focusing on something, dopamine can help us keep things in our short-term memory. It is thought that low levels of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex may contribute to attention deficit disorder.  

### Eating
Dopamine can affect the amount of food to eat before you feel satisfied. This could lead to obesity. 

### Sleep and Tiredness
Dopamine helps us feel more awake, and the body naturally produces more of it during daytime hours when we are more stimulated. As night falls, dopamine levels fall as well, helping us feel tired and ready for bed. People with low dopamine or with conditions such as Parkinson's, which is associated with low dopamine levels, may feel chronic tiredness during all hours of the day.  

### Higher dopamine levels make us act more impulsively
Impulsive behaviour (Instant gratification) is when a person canâ€™t resist the temptation to carry out certain activities. Some people may do an activity without giving any thought to the future or to long-term consequences, and it can have a big impact on the person affected and those around them. When these behaviours are more severe they are classed as impulse control disorders.  

Biologically more implusive people have less active dopamine receptors in their midbrain but their brains would be more likely to fire off large quantities of the neurotransmitter when stimulated. The people who had the highest levels of dopamine release reported subjectively stronger cravings.   

Root cause: 
We have shown for the first time that impulsive behaviour in mice is only triggered when dopamine signals are received and passed on to an unexpected part of the brain -- from the amygdala to the BNST . The BNST is a complex brain structure that orchestrates emotional and behavioural responses to stress.
