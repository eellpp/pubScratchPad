In this episode, you'll discover:  
### What is cortisol? 5:32  
  * Hormone secreted by adrenal glands  
  * Not enough attention is given to cortisol in the medical field  
  * “Stress hormone” — fight or flight response  
  * It is secreted in response to any real or perceived threat or stressor  
  * We're hard-wired to have high cortisol in the am, and low in the evening  
  * Rhythm vs. volume is key  
  * Acute hormone; ex. being chased by a lion  
  * Turns off pain recognition  
  * Anti-inflammatory  
  * Catabolic hormone — wear and tear  
  * We've changed cortisol from an acute to a chronic hormone  
  * Key takeaway: try to find meaningful ways to live w/ the sun's rhythm  
  * Lowest levels are at around 10 pm; allows anabolic hormones testosterone, growth hormone, and melatonin to elevate  
  * Most critical hours of sleep are 10 pm – 2 am  
  * It takes melatonin 12 hours to reset  
  * Later (or no) sun exposure means melatonin levels peak later, leading to loss of sleep quality  
  
### How cortisol is secreted…13:37  
  * Perceived stressors (most often subtle in modern times)  
  * Primitive part of the mid-brain, above the spinal cord  
  * Reticular Activating System (RAS) triggers release of cortisol
  * Signal sent to locus ceruleus (one of the most connected parts of the brain)
  * Signal sent to hypothalamus, to pituitary, then to adrenal glands
  * Norepinephrine and cortisol are “partners in crime”; released along w/ cortisol
  * Pituitary responsible for all signaling molecules
  * We stop releasing cortisol, and have surplus of norepinephrine
  * We release an average of 35 g of cortisol per day
  * Irregular sleep patterns (night shift workers) lead to chronic health problems later in life

### How cortisol imbalances affect our lives…20:12
  * Our brains cannot differentiate between perceived and real stressors
  * Visualizing a success (or a failure) will trigger cortisol secretion
  * “I can't wait to wear that outfit” is much more effective than “I'm way too big…”
  * RAS helps distinguish background and foreground in our world
  * Buy a red truck, all of a sudden you see a bunch of red trucks on the roads
  * What you put your attention is what you're going to get in your life

### How cortisol gets disrupted…25:40
  * Humans are “super-adaptors”; we can tolerate stressors over a long period of time
  * Modern tech can disconnect us from the sun, circadian rhythm, and cortisol flow
  * We release cortisol at night when we look at TV, phones, etc. at night
  * We tolerate stressors for years and decades, but it eventually catches up with us
  * It will eventually blunt the anabolic hormones (testosterone, growth hormone, melatonin)
  * We lose sleep quality, take longer to heal injuries, workouts are more challenging, etc.
  * Gold standard to test adrenal function: salivary cortisol test
  * Salivary is far less stressful than a blood draw (hence more accurate results)
  * We rely on stimulants such as coffee and prescription drugs, rather than address the issue of disrupted cortisol flow

### Why cortisol is such a hot topic in modern society…37:40
  * Acute stressor triggers cortisol
  * Over time, cortisol has become a chronic hormone, rather than an acute hormone
  * We'll never be chased by a lion in the jungle
  * We trigger cortisol response w/ everyday stressors
  * Chipping away at cortisol release over time
  * We can't keep up w/ cortisol demands; lose cortisol reserve
  * Major stressor (loss of job, death in the family, etc.) causes a breakdown when cortisol levels have been chronically disrupted
  * Cancer, autoimmune disease, etc. occur with this breakdown
  * Many fear cancer, other serious illnesses
  * Best way to prevent disease: take care of cortisol levels
  * Be aware of indicators of low cortisol levels: poor sleep, longer than usual recovery times, etc.

### The key element regarding cortisol missed by conventional medicine practice…43:13
  * Adrenal fatigue and insufficiency doesn't exist in conventional medicine
  * Two extremes in conventional medicine: Cushing's disease, and Addison's disease
  * Cushings: too much cortisol secretion
  * Addisons: not enough cortisol is produced
  * There's a gray area; it's not simply black and white
  * As cortisol levels are disrupted, norepinephrine levels increase
  * - Increased heart rate
  * - Increased blood pressure
  * - This feels like anxiety
  * Consider visiting a doctor knowledgeable in this as you may have lost control of the cortisol buffer
  * Study in the Netherlands on men over 50 who ran marathons vs. men who didn't run marathons
  * Men who ran marathons suffered more heart attacks (due to overtraining)
  * Positive exercise can still be a stressor, releasing cortisol
  * Recovery is key to being an elite athlete

### How cortisol interacts with other hormones in the body…49:30
  * Hormones are like kids w/ differing personalities
  * Cortisol is the neighborhood bully
  * High insulin levels and cortisol lead to weight gain (cut carbs in the morning)
  * Abnormal cortisol modulation affects thyroid levels deleteriously
  * Be aware of your adrenal status if you're on thyroid hormone replacement
  * An imbalance of cortisol and testosterone inhibits muscle production
  * Growth hormone depletion leads to brain fog, weight gain, etc.

### How to effectively modulate cortisol…56:52
  * Adrenal glands are like a factory producing hormones: cortisol is the goal, but we need to make the other hormones
  * Cortisol imbalances lead to depletion of other hormones
  * Pregnenolone is made from cholesterol; low cholesterol levels affects cortisol production
  * Number 1 risk factor for cancer for men is low testosterone; cortisol will help optimize health
  * Having a cortisol reserve enables us to handle and tolerate stress, thus preventing cancer, autoimmune disease
  * Behaviors to normalize cortisol levels (deliberate contemplative exercise)
  * - Meditation, prayer, reading
  *  - Activate parasympathetic system, turn off sympathetic system
  *  - Meditation is not the only means of managing stress
  * Adaptogenic herbs:
  *  - Licorice root (delays conversion of cortisol to cortisone)
  *  - Holy basil (sense of the divine in one's world)
  *  - Cordyceps powder (in coffee, shakes)
  * Critical nutrients:
  *  - Intravenous NAD+ ( use code: BEN2020 at check-out to get a 15% off of products and phone consult).
  *  - Peptides: (use code: BEN2020 at check-out to get a 15% off of products and phone consult)
  *  - Hexarelin
  *  - Epithalon
  *  - Ipamorelin
  *  - GHRP 6 and GHRP 2
  *  - Intranasal and intravenous stem cells
  *  - Hydrocortisone replacement (don't surpass 35 mg per day)
  *  - Phosphatidylserine (100-300 mg)
  *  - Ashwagandha (use at bedtime – 300 – 3000mg)
  *  - Glycine (great for the liver, 1000-5000 mg at bedtime)
  *  - CBD (bedtime)
  *  - Good correlation between HRV and cortisol; collect morning and evening times
  *  - Cortisol helps be your best cognitively

If you're feeling tired, stressed and anxious, check your cortisol levels
