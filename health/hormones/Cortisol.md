### What Is Cortisol?

Cortisol is a steroid hormone produced by the adrenal glands, often referred to as the "stress hormone." It plays a crucial role in various bodily functions, including regulating metabolism, reducing inflammation, controlling blood sugar levels, and helping the body respond to stress. While cortisol is essential for health, excessive or prolonged levels can lead to negative effects such as anxiety, weight gain, and weakened immune function.

Maintaining adequate cortisol levels ensures a balanced response to stress and supports overall well-being.

### Top 10 Ways to Keep Adequate Cortisol Levels in Daily Life

1. **Get Quality Sleep**
   - Aim for 7–9 hours of uninterrupted sleep per night. Poor sleep can elevate cortisol levels. Establish a consistent sleep schedule and create a relaxing bedtime routine.

2. **Practice Mindfulness and Meditation**
   - Regular mindfulness practices, such as meditation, deep breathing, or progressive muscle relaxation, help reduce stress and regulate cortisol production.

3. **Exercise Moderately**
   - Engage in moderate exercise like walking, yoga, or swimming. Avoid overtraining, as intense workouts can temporarily increase cortisol levels.

4. **Maintain a Balanced Diet**
   - Include whole foods like fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and healthy fats. Avoid excessive sugar, caffeine, and processed foods, which can spike cortisol levels.

5. **Stay Hydrated**
   - Dehydration can trigger an increase in cortisol. Drink plenty of water throughout the day to support optimal bodily functions.

6. **Cultivate Healthy Relationships**
   - Positive social interactions reduce stress and help regulate cortisol. Spend time with loved ones and seek emotional support when needed.

7. **Set Boundaries and Manage Stress**
   - Avoid overcommitting or taking on too many responsibilities. Learn to say no and prioritize tasks to reduce stress and cortisol levels.

8. **Engage in Hobbies**
   - Participate in enjoyable activities like painting, gardening, or playing a musical instrument. Creative outlets promote relaxation and lower cortisol.

9. **Limit Screen Time**
   - Excessive exposure to screens, especially before bedtime, can disrupt sleep and increase cortisol. Take breaks from devices and establish screen-free zones.

10. **Consider Adaptogens**
    - Natural supplements like ashwagandha, rhodiola, or holy basil may help balance cortisol levels. Consult with a healthcare provider before starting any supplement.

In this episode, you'll discover:  
### What is cortisol? 5:32  
  * Hormone secreted by adrenal glands  
  * Not enough attention is given to cortisol in the medical field  
  * “Stress hormone” — fight or flight response  
  * It is secreted in response to any real or perceived threat or stressor  
  * We're hard-wired to have high cortisol in the am, and low in the evening  
  * Rhythm vs. volume is key  
  * Acute hormone; ex. being chased by a lion  
  * Turns off pain recognition  
  * Anti-inflammatory  
  * Catabolic hormone — wear and tear  
  * We've changed cortisol from an acute to a chronic hormone  
  * Key takeaway: try to find meaningful ways to live w/ the sun's rhythm  
  * Lowest levels are at around 10 pm; allows anabolic hormones testosterone, growth hormone, and melatonin to elevate  
  * Most critical hours of sleep are 10 pm – 2 am  
  * It takes melatonin 12 hours to reset  
  * Later (or no) sun exposure means melatonin levels peak later, leading to loss of sleep quality  
  
### How cortisol is secreted…13:37  
  * Perceived stressors (most often subtle in modern times)  
  * Primitive part of the mid-brain, above the spinal cord  
  * Reticular Activating System (RAS) triggers release of cortisol
  * Signal sent to locus ceruleus (one of the most connected parts of the brain)
  * Signal sent to hypothalamus, to pituitary, then to adrenal glands
  * Norepinephrine and cortisol are “partners in crime”; released along w/ cortisol
  * Pituitary responsible for all signaling molecules
  * We stop releasing cortisol, and have surplus of norepinephrine
  * We release an average of 35 g of cortisol per day
  * Irregular sleep patterns (night shift workers) lead to chronic health problems later in life

### How cortisol imbalances affect our lives…20:12
  * Our brains cannot differentiate between perceived and real stressors
  * Visualizing a success (or a failure) will trigger cortisol secretion
  * “I can't wait to wear that outfit” is much more effective than “I'm way too big…”
  * RAS helps distinguish background and foreground in our world
  * Buy a red truck, all of a sudden you see a bunch of red trucks on the roads
  * What you put your attention is what you're going to get in your life

### How cortisol gets disrupted…25:40
  * Humans are “super-adaptors”; we can tolerate stressors over a long period of time
  * Modern tech can disconnect us from the sun, circadian rhythm, and cortisol flow
  * We release cortisol at night when we look at TV, phones, etc. at night
  * We tolerate stressors for years and decades, but it eventually catches up with us
  * It will eventually blunt the anabolic hormones (testosterone, growth hormone, melatonin)
  * We lose sleep quality, take longer to heal injuries, workouts are more challenging, etc.
  * Gold standard to test adrenal function: salivary cortisol test
  * Salivary is far less stressful than a blood draw (hence more accurate results)
  * We rely on stimulants such as coffee and prescription drugs, rather than address the issue of disrupted cortisol flow

### Why cortisol is such a hot topic in modern society…37:40
  * Acute stressor triggers cortisol
  * Over time, cortisol has become a chronic hormone, rather than an acute hormone
  * We'll never be chased by a lion in the jungle
  * We trigger cortisol response w/ everyday stressors
  * Chipping away at cortisol release over time
  * We can't keep up w/ cortisol demands; lose cortisol reserve
  * Major stressor (loss of job, death in the family, etc.) causes a breakdown when cortisol levels have been chronically disrupted
  * Cancer, autoimmune disease, etc. occur with this breakdown
  * Many fear cancer, other serious illnesses
  * Best way to prevent disease: take care of cortisol levels
  * Be aware of indicators of low cortisol levels: poor sleep, longer than usual recovery times, etc.

### The key element regarding cortisol missed by conventional medicine practice…43:13
  * Adrenal fatigue and insufficiency doesn't exist in conventional medicine
  * Two extremes in conventional medicine: Cushing's disease, and Addison's disease
  * Cushings: too much cortisol secretion
  * Addisons: not enough cortisol is produced
  * There's a gray area; it's not simply black and white
  * As cortisol levels are disrupted, norepinephrine levels increase
  * - Increased heart rate
  * - Increased blood pressure
  * - This feels like anxiety
  * Consider visiting a doctor knowledgeable in this as you may have lost control of the cortisol buffer
  * Study in the Netherlands on men over 50 who ran marathons vs. men who didn't run marathons
  * Men who ran marathons suffered more heart attacks (due to overtraining)
  * Positive exercise can still be a stressor, releasing cortisol
  * Recovery is key to being an elite athlete

### How cortisol interacts with other hormones in the body…49:30
  * Hormones are like kids w/ differing personalities
  * Cortisol is the neighborhood bully
  * High insulin levels and cortisol lead to weight gain (cut carbs in the morning)
  * Abnormal cortisol modulation affects thyroid levels deleteriously
  * Be aware of your adrenal status if you're on thyroid hormone replacement
  * An imbalance of cortisol and testosterone inhibits muscle production
  * Growth hormone depletion leads to brain fog, weight gain, etc.

### How to effectively modulate cortisol…56:52
  * Adrenal glands are like a factory producing hormones: cortisol is the goal, but we need to make the other hormones
  * Cortisol imbalances lead to depletion of other hormones
  * Pregnenolone is made from cholesterol; low cholesterol levels affects cortisol production
  * Number 1 risk factor for cancer for men is low testosterone; cortisol will help optimize health
  * Having a cortisol reserve enables us to handle and tolerate stress, thus preventing cancer, autoimmune disease
  * Behaviors to normalize cortisol levels (deliberate contemplative exercise)
  * - Meditation, prayer, reading
  *  - Activate parasympathetic system, turn off sympathetic system
  *  - Meditation is not the only means of managing stress
  * Adaptogenic herbs:
  *  - Licorice root (delays conversion of cortisol to cortisone)
  *  - Holy basil (sense of the divine in one's world)
  *  - Cordyceps powder (in coffee, shakes)
  * Critical nutrients:
  *  - Intravenous NAD+ ( use code: BEN2020 at check-out to get a 15% off of products and phone consult).
  *  - Peptides: (use code: BEN2020 at check-out to get a 15% off of products and phone consult)
  *  - Hexarelin
  *  - Epithalon
  *  - Ipamorelin
  *  - GHRP 6 and GHRP 2
  *  - Intranasal and intravenous stem cells
  *  - Hydrocortisone replacement (don't surpass 35 mg per day)
  *  - Phosphatidylserine (100-300 mg)
  *  - Ashwagandha (use at bedtime – 300 – 3000mg)
  *  - Glycine (great for the liver, 1000-5000 mg at bedtime)
  *  - CBD (bedtime)
  *  - Good correlation between HRV and cortisol; collect morning and evening times
  *  - Cortisol helps be your best cognitively

If you're feeling tired, stressed and anxious, check your cortisol levels

Other Notes:
- Caffeine increases cortisol secretion in people at rest or undergoing mental stress
- Caffeine begins to affect your body very quickly. It reaches a peak level in your blood within 30 to 60 minutes.
