Graves’s disease. This is an autoimmune disease in which the patient’s own antibodies induce the thyroid gland to produce too much hormone.   

The thyroid is a gland located in the neck that helps control the body’s metabolic rate. Too much thyroid hormone causes the body to race. Too little, and it slows to a crawl. Unchecked, either state can be fatal. Rarely, in some people — usually young, often male — too much thyroid hormone can make circulating potassium levels drop and cause weakness.
