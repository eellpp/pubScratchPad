### Why Saliva matters
Saliva helps prevent tooth decay by neutralizing acids produced by bacteria, limiting bacterial growth and washing away food particles. Saliva also enhances your ability to taste and makes it easier to chew and swallow. In addition, enzymes in saliva aid in digestion.

Dry Mouth also raises your risk for gum disease and tooth decay; new cavities can begin to form within as little as three months after dry mouth begins.  
Many people use candies or gum to combat dry mouth, but such a habit can actually add fuel to the fire, says Connor — sugar feeds bacteria in your mouth.  


### Dry Mouth Causes
Dry mouth is caused when the salivary glands in the mouth don't make enough saliva to keep your mouth wet. These glands may not work properly as the result of:

`Medications`:  Hundreds of medications, including many over-the-counter drugs, produce dry mouth as a side effect. Among the more likely types to cause problems are some of the drugs used to treat depression, high blood pressure and anxiety, as well as some antihistamines, decongestants, muscle relaxants and pain medications.  
`Aging`:  Many older people experience dry mouth as they age. Contributing factors include the use of certain medications, changes in the body's ability to process medication, inadequate nutrition, and having long-term health problems.  
`Other health conditions`: Dry mouth can be due to certain health conditions, such as diabetes, stroke, yeast infection (thrush) in your mouth or Alzheimer's disease, or due to autoimmune diseases, such as Sjogren's syndrome or HIV/AIDS. Snoring and breathing with your mouth open also can contribute to dry mouth.  
`Tobacco and alcohol use`: Drinking alcohol and smoking or chewing tobacco can increase dry mouth symptoms.  

### Dry Mouth Relief
- Drink Water regularly
- Hold water in mouth for a while before swallow

### Tooth 
People with healthy teeth will actually reduce their risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and have lower blood pressure

sugary beverages/food feed destructive oral bacteria. Rinse clean mouth after eating  

Brush Twice a day  
Brush after each big meal   


The stomach acid from repeated vomiting can severely erode tooth enamel. Purging can also trigger swelling in the mouth, throat, and salivary glands as well as bad breath. Anorexia, bulimia, and other eating disorders can also cause serious nutritional shortfalls that can affect the health of your teeth.


### Health Gums
Healthy gums should look pink and firm, not red and swollen. To keep gums healthy, practice good oral hygiene.  

### Stress  
If you are stressed, anxious, or depressed, you may be at higher risk for oral health problems. People under stress produce high levels of the hormone cortisol, which wreaks havoc on the gums and body. Stress also leads to poor oral care; more than 50% of people don't brush or floss regularly when stressed. Other stress-related habits include smoking, drinking alcohol, and clenching and grinding teeth (called bruxism).

### Yellow Teeth
yellow teeth are not an indication of a serious medical problem  
Dentin is a deep, yellow to brown, tinged material inside our teeth under the enamel. It is the primary cause for teeth appearing yellow. Color changes occur when the enamel starts scraping off and more of the dentin reveals itself.  

As a person starts to age, the tooth starts to lay down more dentin, thus reducing the pulp which in turn diminishes the translucent effect of the teeth, giving off a more yellow shade.  

Calcium is like a lifeline for teeth and will prevent enamel erosion. Its regular use will strengthen the enamel and gum lining. Milk, dairy products and broccoli are loaded with calcium.    

Sauces, dark curries and black coffee are big culprits which tend to stain the teeth if used excessively and regularly, since they contain chemicals known as tannins, which are famous for their blemishing properties. Their residue tends to stick on the teeth surface, tarnishing the enamel.   

### Brushing
Be careful with brushing immediately after consuming acidic foods and drinks. Brushing right away can make the acids brush away more enamel and lead to erosion.  

Brush your teeth at least twice a day for 2 minutes at a time. Make sure you get into all of the cracks and crevices. Brush your teeth gently in a circular motion to ensure you’re protecting your gums. Brush the inside, outside, and chewing surfaces of your teeth.

### Eating juicy fruits after food
Chewing on crunchy fruits and vegetables at the end of a meal may increase saliva production. This can help to remove food particles that are stuck in your teeth and wash away any harmful acids.
