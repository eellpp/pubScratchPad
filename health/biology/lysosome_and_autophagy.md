Autophagy, also called autophagocytosis, the degradation of worn, abnormal, or malfunctioning cellular components that takes place within organelles known as lysosomes. Autophagy serves housekeeping functions, enabling the breakdown and recycling of cellular materials, and helps balance energy demands during periods of stress. 

In addition to its housekeeping and stress-response functions, autophagy also contributes to immunity, helping to defend cells against disease-causing organisms and participating in antigen presentation.

Autophagy can also protect against cell death by providing nutrients to cells during periods of starvation.

### Fasting and Autophagy 
Autophagy activity has been shown to increase during intermittent fasting in animal models, with health benefits including clearance of harmful, dysfunctional or “sticky” aggregating proteins in the brain. 

Autophagy is an important biological process that is essential for the removal of damaged organelles and toxic or aggregated proteins by delivering them to the lysosome for degradation.

“If you don’t have a snack between lunch and dinner,” Dr. Cuervo said, “you’re going to have to activate your lysosomes to get nutrients.”

Lysosomes become even more active if dinner never comes, and a short-term hunger turns to long-term starvation. Cells respond to famine by making only a small number of crucial molecules and using lysosomes to destroy the rest.

### Benefits of Autophagy  

Cells make a lot of defective molecules. They misread genes, for example, and misfold proteins. Even a perfectly crafted molecule does not stay perfect for long. “Proteins go bad with time,” Dr. Klionsky said. “They age, and they wear out.”

When proteins and other molecules go bad, they can start to gum up the intricate chemical reactions on which a cell’s survival depends. The cell recognizes defective parts and tags them for destruction. Experiments on flies show the harm that can occur when cells cannot clear away the old and bring in the new. Flies that are genetically engineered with defective lysosomes start to accumulate abnormal clumps of proteins in their cells. The clumps build up especially in their neurons, which start to die as a result.

In recent years, scientists have also found evidence of autophagy in preventing a much wider range of diseases. Many disorders, like Alzheimer’s disease, are the result of certain kinds of proteins forming clumps. Lysosomes can devour these clumps before they cause damage, slowing the onset of diseases.

As mitochondria get old, they cast off charged molecules that can wreak havoc in a cell and lead to potentially cancerous mutations. By gobbling up defective mitochondria, lysosomes may make cells less likely to damage their DNA.  

It has long been known, for example, that animals that are put on a strict low-calorie diet can live much longer than animals that eat all they can. Recent research has shown that caloric restriction raises autophagy in animals and keeps it high. The animals seem to be responding to their low-calorie diet by feeding on their own cells, as they do during famines. In the process, their cells may also be clearing away more defective molecules, so that the animals age more slowly.
