### Why dark skin are black when black absorbs more light
 The darker skin is the result of more of a pigment called melanin. The melanin helps to absorb the UV radiation, and heats the body, rather than causing mutations in our DNA which link thymine together into pairs called dimers. Our body can either utilize blue light to break apart these thymine dimers in a process call photoreactivation, or the bad portion of code can be clipped out, and a proofreader DNA processor (polymerase) can read the opposite strand of DNA to restore the code in a process called nucleotide excision repair. Sometimes this repair process fails. If too many mutations accumulate, a skin cancer can manifest. Basal cell carcinoma is the most common and is caused by chronic sun exposure. Melanomas are less common, but more deadly, and they are associated with acute sun exposure (like a bad sunburn). White people have evolved to allow more sunlight to penetrate cells, thereby synthesizing enough Vitamin D even in winters at northern latitudes where a black person would not thrive without supplementation.
