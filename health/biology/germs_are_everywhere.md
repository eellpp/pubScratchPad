The air you breathe is teeming with more than 1,800 kinds of bacteria

If you think your home is free of bacteria simply because you maintain a rigid cleaning schedule, you're wrong. You'll discover that some of these airborne bacteria exist in your home.

The test found evidence of more than 1,800 types of airborne bacteria. It also showed that location is not as important as the time of year and weather for predicting microbial diversity than location. For example, during warmer and dryer conditions they found increased levels of spore-forming bacteria. 

These bacteria exist in soils and can be aerosolized; driving a tractor across a field on a dry day is a good example of causing high exposure to endotoxin. It can cause fever, shock and asthma.

Airborne microbes can move directly, from person to person through respiration, ingestion, and dermal contact or indirectly, from waste handling and loading of sewage, biosolids or animal wastes (Earth Materials and Health, pg.59). Also, fungal spores released by soil fungi into the wind can be a natural mechanism of transportation. The concept of airborne microbes is general. People can be affected basically by any naturally occurring or human caused process that kicks up dust or other small particles that might blow in the wind.

Outdoor concentrations of airborne bacteria generally were higher than those indoors but similar in summer and winter. Bacterial concentrations indoors showed more seasonal difference, which may be due to changes in occupant dress and activities as well as ventilation patterns during the cooling and heating seasons...The preliminary results in this paper provide baseline information on the concentrations of culturable bacteria in commercial and public buildings in the United States.

Just like on Earth, there is a robust population of bacteria and fungi on the International Space Station (ISS) â€” and a new study catalogues its exact composition.  
Most of the microbes are associated with humans, particularly the bacteria Staphylococcus (26% of total bacteria isolated), Pantoea (23%) and Bacillus (11%), according to a statement on the new work. Other organisms come from specific parts of humans, such as Staphylococcus aureus (10%), which is usually found in human nasal passages and skin. Another example is Enterobacter, whose percentage was not specified in the release, which is found in the human gastrointestinal tract.  
They came from eight locations on the ISS, including the dining table, toilet, exercise equipment, a viewing window and sleeping quarters.
