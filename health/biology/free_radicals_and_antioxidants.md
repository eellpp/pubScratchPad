#### What is free radical damage? 
Free radicals are molecules with only one electron, or an unpaired electron, in their outer orbital. Free radicals have a habit of stealing electrons from any molecule they come across to make themselves stable and it’s what causes all the trouble and potentially can cause cellular injury.

During cellular respiration, highly reactive molecules called free radicals are formed within mitochondria. Perhaps the best known free radical produced in this way is the superoxide radical, O2-. 
These unstable forms of oxygen are sometimes called free radicals.   

Free radicals are potentially very damaging to cell components such as proteins and genetic material like DNA and RNA. 

Basically, I think of free radicals as waste products from various chemical reactions in the cell that when built up, harm the cells of the body.

The challenges of inflammation and oxidative stress can lead to DNA damage, protein misfolding, and loss of ATP production in mitochondria. This can result in cell death and loss of cognitive functions in the brain

### How Free Radical damages cells
Free radicals can cause damage to parts of cells such as proteins, DNA, and cell membranes by stealing their electrons through a process called oxidation. (This is why free radical damage is also called “oxidative damage.”) When free radicals oxidize important components of the cell, those components lose their ability to function normally, and the accumulation of such damage may cause the cell to die. Numerous studies indicate that increased production of free radicals causes or accelerates nerve cell injury and leads to disease.

### Free radicals and Antioxidants need to be balanced
Your immune cells use free radicals to fight infections  
As a result, your body needs to maintain a certain balance of free radicals and antioxidants.  
When free radicals outnumber antioxidants, it can lead to a state called oxidative stress.   

### Free Radical generating substances
These substances include fried foods, alcohol, tobacco smoke, pesticides and air pollutants. 
- air pollution
- cigarette smoke
- alcohol intake
- toxins
- high blood sugar levels
- high intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids
- radiation, including excessive sunbathing
- bacterial, fungal, or viral infections
- excessive intake of iron, magnesium, copper, or zinc (
- too much or too little oxygen in your body 
- intense and prolonged exercise, which causes tissue damage 
- excessive intake of antioxidants, such as vitamins C and E 
- antioxidant deficiency 

### Free radicals and exercise
According to an article in Biochemical Society Transactions, intense aerobic exercise can induce oxidative stress. Burning fuel in high-intensity cardio exercise causes chemical reactions that make free radicals form at a faster rate.  

Regular exercise alone was enough to build up antioxidant defenses against the initial exercise-induced oxidative stress. 
Therefore, out of shape and infrequent exercisers who do a spontaneous bout of intense physical activity may invoke oxidative stress, while those who are consistently active should not worry.

### Antioxidants
Antioxidants are molecules that fight free radicals in your body. 

Your body has its own antioxidant defenses to keep free radicals in check.

However, antioxidants are also found in food, especially in fruits, vegetables, and other plant-based, whole foods. Several vitamins, such as vitamins E and C, are effective antioxidants.

Berries, green tea, coffee, and dark chocolate are renowned for being good sources of antioxidants  

Excessive intake of isolated antioxidants can have toxic effects and may even promote rather than prevent oxidative damage — a phenomenon termed the “antioxidant paradox”
