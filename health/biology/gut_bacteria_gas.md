bacteria in your large intestine break down undigested carbohydrates. 

According to the actual research, most healthy people have about 10 to 20 discharges per day.  

A little gas can be good, even smelly gases like hydrogen sulfide. It tells you the bacteria in your gut are doing their job.  Indeed, there is a new category of food ingredients called prebiotics that are now being added to yogurt, kefir, crackers, and other foods for the purpose of nourishing gut bacteria.  

food that contain certain carbohydrates resist digestion in the stomach and small intestine and make their way to the colon.  Upon arrival, they become food for the trillions of bacteria that reside there.  These bacteria ferment these carbohydrates and produce gases, mainly hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane.  Some gases are absorbed, some are expelled via breathing, and some are recycled by other bacteria.  But the gas that remains is dischraged from rectum.   

Lactose, which is the sugar found in milk products, is one of the most common carbohydrates that some people have problems digesting. Some other foods, such as beans, contain fiber, a form of carbohydrate, which no one is able to digest. In a healthy digestive system, a small amount of carbohydrates passing through undigested is not a problem

### Either we digest or bacteria digest
In order for carbohydrates to be absorbed in the small intestine, the proper digestive enzymes are needed to break down, or digest, them. For example, the enzyme lactase is needed to digest the carbohydrate lactose; a lack of the enzyme is what causes lactose intolerance. Once digested, the carbohydrate can be absorbed by the hair-like villi in the small intestine and pass into the bloodstream. If the proper digestive enzyme is not present or food is moving too quickly through the digestive tract, the carbohydrate will pass into the large intestine undigested.

Upon reaching your large intestine, the undigested carbohydrate meets a colony of beneficial bacteria, which help to maintain your health and immune function. The bacteria use the undigested carbohydrate as an energy source and produce both carbon dioxide and methane gasses in the process. In your body, gas and bloating may arise from the buildup of gases released by the bacterial fermentation.


### bacteria also produces food for body
 The bacteria produce an arsenal of enzymes that break down these carbs into simple sugars, which are then in turn fermented to create short-chain fatty acids that human cells can absorb—and which can contribute as much as 10 percent of the calories our own cells require.

 Microbes are now being engineered to break down plant cell wall polysaccharides to turn them into biofuels,


### Bacteria remodelling by intermittant fasting
Recent studies suggest that intermittent fasting can alter the composition of the human gut microbiome by increasing taxonomic diversity and promoting microbial remodeling.

During fasting, a particular family of anaerobic bacteria called Lachnospiraceae flourished. This group of bacteria, part of the order Clostridiales, is responsible for a process called butryogenesis in the gut, which has beneficial metabolic and anti-aging effects. The metabolic and maybe health-span-enhancing advantages of intermittent fasting and food restriction may be related to changes in the microbiome.

### Immune system and bacteria
The gut microbiota that resides in the gastrointestinal tract provides essential health benefits to its host, particularly by regulating immune homeostasis. Moreover, it has recently become obvious that alterations of these gut microbial communities can cause immune dysregulation, leading to autoimmune disorders.

By using GF mice that were fecal-transplanted with human gut microbiota, one study demonstrated that switching from a low-fat, plant polysaccharide-rich diet to a high-fat, high-sugar diet can shift the configuration of the microbiome in one day.104 This diet-altered microbiome was able to rapidly promote obesity in the mice within two weeks.  

### factors affecting bacteria composition

Antibiotic treatments, vaccinations and hygiene practices all can alter gut microbiota composition.   

As we are born sterile, bacterial colonization during and shortly after birth also plays an important role in shaping the communities of gut microbiota. Thus, the prematurity of an infant’s birth, the method of delivery, and the infant’s food source (e.g., breast milk, commercial formula, etc.) all have a major impact during the acquisition phase of the gut microbiota development. For example, vaginally-born infants were dominantly colonized by bacteria communities that resembled their mother’s vaginal microbiota which includes Lactobacillus, Prevotella, or Sneathia spp, while caesarean section (C-section)-born infants harbored bacteria mostly found on the skin surface such as Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium and Propionibacterium spp110 Furthermore, premature infants had a predominant colonization of C. difficile.109 Formula-fed infants were often associated with the colonization of Staphylococci, E. coli, C. difficile, Bacteroides, Atopobium and Lactobacilli and a delayed colonization of Bifidobacterium species.109,111-115 Some of the changes in microbial communities in early life due to certain practices such as C-section might increase one’s risk in developing asthma, allergy and autoimmune disease in the later childhood.
