By logic, as people get older, they should get leaner to reduce the negative effects of fat and weight related issues on mobility and health.   
But in a counterintuitive way, the body fat increases. Why ?

Everyone of a certain age recognizes that it takes ever more effort to evade or get rid of excess fat tissue. why ?
 
### Reduced Lipid Turnover

Many people struggle to keep their weight in check as they get older. Now new research at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden has uncovered why that is: Lipid turnover in the fat tissue decreases during ageing and makes it easier to gain weight, even if we don't eat more or exercise less than before. The study is published in the journal Nature Medicine.

Prior studies have shown that one way to speed up the lipid turnover in the fat tissue is to exercise more.  

Lipids include fats (solid at room temperature) and oils (liquid at room temperature). Lipid Turnover is the breakdown of fats for energy.

### sarcopenia
The amount of lean muscle mass we have is the primary determinant of metabolic rate. In other words, the more muscle mass we have, the more calories we will burn. Our muscle mass naturally begins to decline around age 30, and that process, called sarcopenia, accelerates around age 40. Unless something is done to actively protect and build up that lean muscle mass, our bodies will require fewer calories, our metabolisms will slow, and the lost muscle will be replaced by fat.  
So, what can you do to prevent sarcopenia? Dr. Apovian offers three tips:

- "Exercise with weights at least twice per week, building up in both weight and intensity as you progress," she says.
- "Eat a diet rich in lean protein sources, including protein smoothies."
- "Get plenty of sleep," Dr. Apovian concludes. "Amongst other health benefits, this gives the body time to repair and rebuild the muscles."

 Men often gain weight until about age 55, and then begin to lose weight later in life. This may be related to a drop in the male sex hormone testosterone. Women usually gain weight until age 65, and then begin to lose weight. Weight loss later in life occurs partly because fat replaces lean muscle tissue, and fat weighs less than muscle. Diet and exercise habits can play a large role in a person's weight changes over their lifetime.  
 
 
 
Energy is delivered to the body in the form of calories. And if you keep your caloric intake exactly the same as you get older, those unburned calories end up as fat.

Muscles are the energy powerhouse of our body, that's where most of our calories are burned. And when we talk about metabolism, what we're really talking about is how efficiently those powerhouse cells — the muscle cells of our body — burn the energy we bring in.

We lose muscle cells as we age. When younger muscle cells get damaged, they're quickly repaired. That's not the case with older muscles.

### Exercise
And that's where exercise comes in. Wanagat says countless studies have shown that exercise — even among individuals in their 80s — works. It actually helps the muscle cells get bigger. And beyond size, it makes the muscles stronger.

"We aren't sure exactly how exercise makes muscles stronger, but we know that when we measure the grip strength of the hands or feet, grip is strongest just after exercise, even among people in their 80s and 90s. So weightlifting at any age offers low risk and great benefit, says Wanagat.

### Immune System Inflammation
we age the immune system can get out of whack, turning on an inflammatory response when there are no bacteria or viruses to kill, and keeping it on long after the body's invaders have left. Such an inappropriate inflammatory response can actually damage one's own cells in whatever part of the body the inflammation occurs, whether it's in muscles, joints or organs.

Ensuring such muscle and joint strength can also help fight this and other unfortunate aspects of aging, arthritis and inflammation. People over 75 are likely to have chronic joint problems, says Greendale. The joints are less able to tolerate the strain and stress of movement; they can be painful and swollen. Building joint and muscle strength can defend against that.
