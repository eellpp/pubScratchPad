Mitochondria are known as the powerhouses of the cell. They are organelles that act like a digestive system which takes in nutrients, breaks them down, and creates energy rich molecules for the cell. The biochemical processes of the cell are known as cellular respiration.  

The most prominent roles of mitochondria are to produce the energy currency of the cell, ATP (i.e., phosphorylation of ADP), through respiration, and to regulate cellular metabolism. The central set of reactions involved in ATP production are collectively known as the citric acid cycle, or the Krebs cycle.

### Mitochondria creates water inside cell
The mitochondria are the only places in the cell where oxygen is reduced and eventually broken down into water. 
During citric acid cycle, it breaks down oyxygen O2 and glucose C6H12O6 to release water and CO2.

Since glucose, fats and proteins are all used as fuel sources for this reaction, the rate of carbon dioxide production is less than the rate of oxygen consumption. In simple words, we produce less carbon dioxide than the amount of oxygen we consume. 

During each breath the CO2 is released. Carbon dioxide molecules are dissolved directly into the blood, they bind with proteins (particularly hemoglobin in the blood). Due to certain chemical properties of carbon dioxide, it is much more soluble in human blood than oxygen. This tendency of carbon dioxide molecules to dissolve readily in the blood comes in pretty handy while removing them from within the cells in which theyâ€™re produced. The dissolved carbon dioxide is then carried up to the lungs, where the alveoli take it out of the blood and send it out for exhalation.
