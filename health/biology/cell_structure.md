Organelles of the Cell (updated)

Topics:
- 3 Main sections
- Cytoplasm : The gel like structure inside cell  
- Cell membrane : Allows entry and exit into the cell. Made of proteins
- Nucleus: Contains the DNA. DNA are in thread like structure called chromatin. When cell is ready to divide, the DNA organise in chromosome  
- Nucleolus : the centre dense part of the inside nucleus. It produces ribosome
- Ribosomes : Ribsome create proteins. The process is called protein transalation. 
- Rough ER : Outside of nucleus. The zig zag structure through which the ribosome has to pass through. Ribosome attach to rough ER and release protien. The Rough ER release the protein inside the cell within a protective vesicle.  
- Smooth ER : They don't have any ribosome attached. The create fats. 
- Golgi body : The vesicles with protein inside release by ribosome travel within the cell and are absorbed by the golgi body. Inside the golgi body the proteins are folded into shapes which dictates what kind of job they can do. Inside the golgi body the protein can also attach to other molecules like carbohyderates, lipids etc.  Finally the proteins are release outside of the cell membrane into the body to perform its job  
- Vesicles : 
- Mitochondria : They create ATP molecules which are the energy molecules for the cell. The mitochondria has its own nucleus, DNA and can repair and reproduce. It is thought that mitichondria was an independent living organism and got trapped inside the cell. 
- Endosymbiosis : This is thought of as the process by which mitochondria got trapped inside the cell. 
- Lysosomes : Contains digestive enzymizes. It does cleanup inside the cell by absorbing and destroying the cell wastage/damaged parts. They also destroy invading bacteria and virus. The bacteria is absorbed into the cell where it destroyed by lysosomes.  When the cell is not performing well, the lysosomes destroy it. 
- Cilia : 
- Flagella : 
- Chloroplasts : These are found inside of plant cell can contains molecule called chlorophyll. This produces glucose/sugar in chemical reaction with sunlight, water and carbon dioxide.  
- Vacuole : Holds water. For plant cell this is largest organelles. In animal cell this is very small.  
- Cell wall
