### Yeast

Yeast is a living organism. It can be used to make bread and alcoholic drinks such as beer and wine. Different species of yeast may cause infections such as thrush.
Yeat is kind of fungi.  

Yeast consists of single cells. They are smaller than animal and plant cells, but slightly larger than bacteria.

These cells also have several similarities with cells of (green) plants and animals, but lots of differences, which is why they are put into a kingdom of their own.

On the outside of the cell is a cell wall, but it is not made of cellulose.

Inside this is a membrane enclosing the cytoplasm.

- A yeast cell contains a nucleus, like those in plant and animal cells  
- There are mitochondria in yeast cells.  
- There are no chloroplasts in yeast cells.  
- Yeast cells do contain ribosomes, the same size as ribosomes in animal and plant cells.  

#### What do yeast eat
Yeasts feed on sugars and starches, which are abundant in bread dough! They turn this food into energy and release carbon dioxide gas as a result. This process is known as fermentation. The carbon dioxide gas made during fermentation is what makes a slice of bread so soft and spongy.

Bread is probably the most common food made from yeast. The yeast makes bread dough rise by producing bubbles of carbon dioxide. The gluten in flour, a protein that makes bread dough elastic, helps trap the carbon dioxide bubbles from the yeast. Making bread is a good way to see the action of yeast – there are many recipes on the Internet, and freshly baked bread is just about the nicest smell there is.
Wine and beer use yeasts to turn sugar into alcohol. Marmite and Vegemite are made from yeast extract, a by-product of beer making. Kefir, which is similar to yogurt, uses yeast to ferment the milk.

### Bacteria
Bacteria are prokaryotes. They are single-celled organisms, with a single circular chromosome, no membrane bound nucleus or organelles, and have a flagella for motility. 

- Bacteria consist of single cells. They are much smaller than animal or plant cells.  
- These cells have several similarities with cells of (green) plants and animals, but lots of differences, which is why they are put into a kingdom of their own.  
- On the outside of the cell is a cell wall, but it is not usually made of cellulose.  
- Inside this is a membrane enclosing the cytoplasm.  
- The genetic material is not enclosed in a nuclear membrane like higher plants and animals. The main genetic material is DNA, in a diffuse blob, loose in the cytoplasm. Also in the cytoplasm there may be other loops of DNA which are called plasmids. This plasmid DNA is likely to contain genes for other characteristics.  
- There are no mitochondria in bacterial cells. In fact they are about the same size as one another.  
- Likewise, there are no chloroplasts in bacterial cells.  
- Bacterial cells do contain ribosomes, but they are slightly smaller than ribosomes in animal and plant cells.  

Yoghurt is fermented milk. The milk is mixed with a starter containing live lactic acid bacteria. The bacteria eat the milk sugars and produce lactic acid, which makes the milk proteins tangle together (coagulate) and turns the milk into yoghurt.  

Cheese-making uses bacteria, and different types of bacteria give the cheeses their specific tastes.

#### But what do bacteria eat?
Well, many bacteria eat starches and sugars which can be found on more or less all organic matter.  For other bacteria their diet is not very different from yours because they live in your mouth or digestive system and eat the food you eat!  Other bacteria eat or dead and decaying matter (they are, along with fungi the ‘decomposers’ of organic matter) and some even eat waste products or dangerous materials like oil.  Basically, there are lots of different bacteria out there and between them they will eat just about anything!

Candida is a strain of fungus that can cause an infection in your skin, among other locations. In normal conditions, your skin may host small amounts of this fungus.  
Candida skin infections can occur on almost any area of the body, but they are more commonly found in intertriginous regions. This is where two skin areas touch or rub together. Such areas include the armpits, groin, and skin folds, as well as the area between your fingers and toes. The fungus thrives in warm, moist, and sweaty conditions.
