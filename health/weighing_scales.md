### How it Works
Such scales work with the help of sensors underneath your feet that use bioelectrical impedance. When you step on the scale, a small electrical current runs up through your leg and across your pelvis, measuring the amount of resistance from body fat.Then, the sensors in the scale measure the level of resistance that the current met as it travels back through your other leg.  

As a rule of thumb, greater body resistance means a higher fat percentage. This is due to the fact that fat contains less water than muscle, so itâ€™s denser than muscle and more difficult for a current to travel through.

### Clean Feets
As a tip, which I read in the Fitzgerald book I referenced above, in order to get an accurate body fat % reading, you should dampen the soles of you feet and quickly dry them with a towel (don't dry them thoroughly, just pat dry them) before stepping on the scale, since these improves conductivity. The manual for the scale says you have to have clean feet to get proper readings, but I think it's a little more than that.

Just enter your height, age and male / female as well as athlete or not. Then you are ready to go. You can use the scale with body fat and water % measurements or just for weight.

### Approximate reading

Anna tested six different body fat measurement methods, and her body fat percentage ranged from 14.2 percent to 26.4 percent, depending on the test. So, as with the scale, you have to take that number with a grain of salt.  

Take a huge drink of water and watch your fat percentage change by up to 10 percent.
