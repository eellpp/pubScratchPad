As you doze off, you enter the first stage of non-REM. This lasts less than 10 minutes and is considered a light sleep. Your breathing and heart rate decelerate and your muscles relax as you slip into the second stage of non-REM sleep, where your body temperature drops and your brain waves get slower. Then you enter the third stage, known as deep sleep, when your body repairs your bones and muscles, strengthens your immune system, releases hormones and restores your energy.   

After that, REM sleep begins, and your heart rate, breathing and brain activity all increase. Brain regions involved in processing emotions and sensory input (from your dream world) light up. Meanwhile, your brain paralyzes the muscles in your arms and legs, preventing you from acting out your dreams, Dr. Dasgupta explained.   

Ideally, you move through the four stages in 90- to 110-minute cycles that repeat four to six times in a typical night. Then, after your last REM cycle, you wake up rested and alert.  

### Benefits
A form of overnight therapy: There’s evidence that your brain divorces memories from their emotional charge — removing the “sharp, painful edges” from life’s difficulties.  

REM also makes us better learners. During this sleep stage, your brain strengthens neural connections formed by the previous day’s experiences and integrates them into existing networks, Dr. Robbins said.    

Although most physical processes, like repairing bone and muscle tissues, happen during the non-REM sleep stages, some hormonal changes occur while someone is in REM, Dr. Walker said, like the release of testosterone (which peaks at the onset of the first REM cycle).   

### Lack of sleep issues
You may have more trouble learning, processing emotional experiences or solving problems.   

Dysregulated REM sleep is also linked with cognitive and mental health issues, like slower thinking and depression.  

### DO not do this   
Cutting your sleep short by going to bed late and then using an alarm clock to wake up can put you at risk for chronic deprivation of REM sleep.  

Having an alcoholic drink before bed also “markedly impairs your REM sleep,” Dr. Walker said, because the process of metabolizing alcohol produces compounds that affect sleep cycle regulation. What’s more, Dr. Gurubhagavatula explained, moderate and heavy drinkers have a higher risk of REM sleep behavior disorder.   

Antidepressants can also reduce REM sleep or trigger REM sleep behavior disorder. And specific conditions — like narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea and depression — can elevate your risk of REM abnormalities,  


Use of portable light-emitting devices immediately before bedtime has biological effects that may perpetuate sleep deficiency and disrupt circadian rhythms, both of which can have adverse impacts on performance, health, and safety.
