The deepest and most regenerative sleep occurs between 10 p.m. - 2 a.m. After 2am, your sleep becomes more superficial. If you are not getting the deep, regenerative sleep that occurs between 10 p.m. - 2 a.m., then you may wake up between 2 a.m. – 3 a.m., when the sleep cycle naturally becomes more superficial, and have trouble falling back to sleep.  If your body is chronically deprived of the regenerative sleep between 10 p.m. - 2 a.m., then you may still feel fatigued when you wake up in the morning.

You have an internal clock lodged deep within the brain that regulates your sleep – the pineal gland. The pineal gland receives information about the sun through your eyes via the optic nerve. As the sun sets, the pineal gland is able to sense the change in light transmitted through your eyes and it begins to secrete a hormone, melatonin, to prepare your body for sleep. 

Exposure to bright light prevents the secretion of melatonin and darkness promotes it. Typically, within one to two hours after the sunset, you will begin to feel drowsy as the melatonin levels rise. This is the body’s signal to go to sleep. By midnight your melatonin levels have peaked and there is a gradual decline in melatonin levels after midnight.  

At 10 p.m., your body goes through a transformation following the rise in melatonin production. This transformational phase of sleep is associated with an increase in the “internal” metabolic activity that is responsible for the repair and restoration of your body. A reduction of your mental and physical activity is necessary for this 10 p.m. shift to occur.  If you are still awake, the “second wind” phenomenon occurs at 10 p.m. because there is a rise in mental activity and energy at this time. However, the true value of the “second wind” can only be experienced if you are asleep by 10 p.m.

Scientists are just beginning to discover the antioxidant role of melatonin. Your body produces numerous natural antioxidants that prevent cellular and DNA damage, which ultimately causes disease. One of the powerful nocturnal antioxidants produced is melatonin. As you sleep, your body is removing the effects of free radicals that have been produced by stress throughout the day. This natural, nocturnal clean-up crew maintains physical balance without any effort. All you need to do to benefit from this process is to sleep when your pineal gland sends the melatonin signal.

#### Cortisol and sleep
Lowest Cortisol levels are at around 10 pm; allows anabolic hormones testosterone, growth hormone, and melatonin to elevate  
We lose sleep quality, take longer to heal injuries, workouts are more challenging, etc.   
Be aware of indicators of low cortisol levels: poor sleep, longer than usual recovery times, etc.  
Most critical hours of sleep are 10 pm – 2 am  

#### Sleep Cycles

Sleep is not simply a period of inactivity. It is in some ways more complex than our waking life, at least in terms of brain activity. Sleep consists broadly of three quite different types, and they shift from one to another and back over the course of 90 minutes or more. (It is a myth that it is 90 minutes for everyone, there is quite a bit of variation.)

The first such sleep cycle contains a great deal of slow-wave sleep, characterized by delta waves, slow and strong brainwaves that are synchronized across most of the brain, on both sides. This is a deeply relaxing sleep, and it does not only give the brain itself some rest. It also stimulates the release of the precursor hormone to the Human Growth Hormone, which stimulates growth in children and regeneration in adults.

The next sleep cycle contains less delta sleep and more REM, the vivid dream sleep that is necessary to maintain sanity. We need both types. The balance shifts, so that toward the morning there is usually no slow-wave sleep in adults, only REM sleep and the intermediate form that is similar to meditation and daydreams but less conscious than either.

So in order to rest your brain and regenerate your body, you need the first sleep cycles. In order to stay mentally healthy, solve problems and stay alert, you need the later. This is why it is a bad idea to only sleep four hours a night unless you are one of the lucky few who are born with less need for sleep.
