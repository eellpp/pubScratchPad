 Other behaviors that help regulate your biological clock include having a consistent eating schedule and not eating too late, exercising regularly, getting some morning sunlight and avoiding blue light in the evening.   

 Maintaining a sleep environment that is dark, quiet and cool. 

###  Prepare a wind-down routine

 Just before getting to bed, shower, bathe, or wash your face and forehead. Water, as an energy, cleanses away unwanted thoughts.  
 Say some prayers to end the day with gratitude, forgiveness and positivity.   
 Lay on the bed.  
 - Try to read somethings that gets you into sleep
 - Try to close eyes and breathe and gently get into sleep.
