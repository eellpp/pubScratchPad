Normal Range is 120/80
- Elivated is 130 and more
- Hyptertension is 140 and more

If you have slightly high blood pressure, your doctor may suggest these steps:

- lose weight if you are overweight,
- get regular physical activity,
- cut down on alcohol, and
- change your food choices to those with less salt and fat

A special eating plan called “DASH” can help you lower your blood pressure. DASH stands for “Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension.” The DASH eating plan emphasizes fruits, vegetables, fat–free or low–fat milk and milk products, whole–grain products, fish, poultry, beans, seeds, and nuts. The DASH eating plan also contains less salt/sodium, sweets, added sugars, sugar containing beverages, fats, and red meats than the typical American diet.

Since fruits and vegetables are naturally lower in sodium than many other foods, DASH makes it easier to lower sodium in the diet. You can also use less salt when you cook and don't bring the salt shaker to the table. Remember, salt/sodium is found in many restaurant and fast-food meals, processed foods, such as soups, convenience meals from the freezer, some breads and cereals, and salted snacks. Your blood pressure is affected by what you eat.


**Reduce Salt and Increase Pottasium** :
Potassium, on the other hand, is the counter to sodium, helping to flush the mineral out of the body, per the AHA. Potassium also helps to relax blood pressure walls—and more relaxed walls mean lower blood pressure. 
 
Plantains are higher in potassium, magnesium, and vitamin C than bananas. 
- spinach, pomegranate and bananas
- leafy green vegetables


**Aerobic exercise** :  
Activities like walking, jogging, swimming, and cycling are excellent for cardiovascular health and blood pressure control.
Strength training:  
Incorporate resistance exercises to build muscle, which can help your body burn calories more efficiently.

**Sleeping** :
People who sleep six hours or less may have steeper increases in blood pressure. If you already have high blood pressure, not sleeping well may make your blood pressure worse. It's thought that sleep helps the body control hormones needed to control stress and metabolism.


**Stress reduction** :  
Chronic stress can contribute to high blood pressure. Practice relaxation techniques like meditation, yoga, or deep breathing to manage stress.


**Limit alcohol** :   
Excessive alcohol consumption can raise blood pressure. If you drink, do so in moderation.

**Maintain a healthy weight** :
Losing excess weight can significantly reduce blood pressure. A combination of a healthy diet and regular exercise is key to achieving and maintaining a healthy weight.

**Intermittant Fasting** :   
Studies have shown a beneficial effect of fasting on lowering blood pressure. Fasting also has benefits on weight, diabetes, and cholesterol. A safe fasting plan should include a discussion with your healthcare provider, plans for any medications you take, and a commitment to staying hydrated and getting enough nutrition.
Monitor your blood pressure:
Regularly check your blood pressure to track your progress and make necessary adjustments to your lifestyle.

16/8 fasting :  
Twice a week : Eat for 8 hours and then fast for 16 hours.   

**Improper Sleep Time** :
irregular sleep schedules can contribute to sleep-deprivation and affect the body’s circadian rhythm. When the circadian rhythm is disturbed, the balance between the body’s ability to react to danger (sympathetic nervous system) and its ability to relax after the danger has passed (parasympathetic nervous system) is disrupted, and BP increases. Circadian disruption can also lead to other adverse health effects such as impaired glucose control, obesity, heart attack, stroke and mood disorders


The takeaway
It's important to remember that lifestyle changes take time to show results. Consult with a healthcare professional before making significant changes to your diet or exercise routine, especially if you have underlying health conditions. By incorporating these tips into your daily life, you can take steps to naturally lower your blood pressure and improve your overall well-being.
