As you start to get into your 40s and 50s, you will notice a number of things that start to change with your eyes. First of all, people of this age will start to notice that they can’t focus as quickly or as accurately as they once could. Reading a menu at a restaurant or text messages on your phone becomes difficult. This condition is known as presbyopia and it is caused by the hardening of the eyes’ lenses. Presbyopia will result in difficulty to read or do work that requires accurate focus.  

Some common symptoms of presbyopia include:  
- headaches from working with objects up close
- eye fatigue
- blurred vision at close distances
- inability to read up close
- the need to hold objects further away in order to bring them into focus

### Eye Vitamins for Presbyopia (Aging Vision)  
Omega-3 fatty acids are really easy to get – just eat fish! Eating healthy servings of grilled fish about three times a week will get you the recommended dosage of omega-3s. Don’t like fish? Simple – take a fish oil supplement!

Vitamin C can be found in a variety of sources, including oranges, guavas, peppers, and kale. As long as you are eating the recommended serving of fruit or dark green vegetables per day (depending on your age and gender), you should be getting enough vitamin C to support your eye health.

Make sure to snack on some oranges if you don’t think you are getting enough

Vitamin A is also essential for healthy eyes, so make sure you are getting enough if you have presbyopia. Some natural sources include sweet potatoes, spinach, greens, and romaine lettuce. Again, consider a supplement if you just cannot change your diet!

### Diseases that effect vision with age 
 Any disease that affects your cardiovascular system will affect your eyes. The eyes rely on tons of tiny blood vessels to transmit blood to and from the optic nerve. Simply having high or low blood pressure can impact your ability to see.  
 
## Exercises

### 10-10-10 Rule
 10-10-10: Every 10 minutes, look at something 10 feet away, for at least 10 seconds.  
 This short vision break is so important, you might want to print it out and hang it in your office or near your computer to remind you to take a vision break every 10 minutes while you’re working.  


### Eye Exercises for Nearsightedness
Here is a range of different exercises to combat nearsightedness. Make sure that you do these tasks every day to get the maximum benefit from them. And don’t forget, you want to complete each exercise fully before moving on to the next and you’ll also want to ensure that you can complete the entire eye regime without being interrupted.

### Eye-Finger Exercise
This exercise will help you to focus on objects that are far away from you. You’ll need to stand in the middle of the room and keep your back straight. Face a picture on the wall and hold your index finger a couple of inches away from your nose. Focus on your fingertip and ensure that your eyes are fully focused before moving on to the next step.

Now you should quickly move your vision to the picture of the wall. At first the image will be distorted. Keep looking until your eyes have correctly focused on the picture. As you get better at it, increase the distance between yourself and the image.

### Focus Exercise
For this exercise you’ll need to be sitting down and you will also need a pencil. Hold the pencil about six inches away from the tip of your nose. Don’t stare at the pencil, instead quickly glance at it and then change your vision to an object which is on the opposite side of the room. Do this for a few seconds and then go back to the pencil for a few seconds.

Repeat this process 10 times and do it every day. As your eyesight starts to get better, start focusing on objects that are further away from you.

### Another Pencil Exercise
Here you’ll again need to be sitting down. This time, hold the pencil away from your eyes until it gets to the point where it starts to double in your vision. Hold it just before this point. Imagine that there is a transparent tic-tac-toe board just in front of you.

Now move the pencil and touch each of the imaginary squares and bring the pencil back to the original position. As you’re moving the pencil, make sure that you track its movement with your eyes.

Again, perform this exercise at least once a day and you should start to notice a gradual improvement in your vision.

### Room Scanning
Find a comfortable chair to sit in and make sure that you sit somewhere where there are a lot of objects to look at. Maybe this could be in your living room or your garden. Now start at one side and slowly scan everything in the room. Look at each object in great detail, make sure that you outline the entire object, then move on to the next one.

For this exercise to work, you will want to look at things in a slow and steady motion. This will help you to focus on things that are both close to your and far away from you.
