•   Type 2 diabetes is a potentially reversible condition
•   If a person has type 2 diabetes, they have become too heavy for their own body (nothing to do with the arbitrary concept of obesity)
•   Weight loss of around 15kg is necessary for most people
•   This can be achieved using a simple 3-step method: the 1, 2, 3 of diabetes reversal
•   Type 2 diabetes is most easily reversed to normal in the early years after diagnosis
•   How and why type 2 diabetes happens can now be understood

### Reversing Type 2 Diabetes and ongoing remission

Reversing the twin cycles of Type 2 diabetes  was that too much fat within liver builds up as a vicious cycle. This overspills to the rest of the body, including the pancreas. This starts up a second vicious cycle in the pancreas which prevents normal production of insulin.

Proof of the hypothesis was published in 2011 as the Counterpoint‌.

Further studies showed that once the vicious cycles of type 2 diabetes had been reversed, the remission of diabetes was durable – as long as weight was not regained. very low calorie diet and 6 months of weight stability in Type 2 diabetes

Different people have different levels of tolerance of fat within liver and pancreas. If you have type 2 diabetes, you have crossed your ‘personal fat thresholds’. But if you lose weight and go below your personal fat threshold, type 2 diabetes will disappear.
