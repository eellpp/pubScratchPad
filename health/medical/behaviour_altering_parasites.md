## Behaviour Altering Parasites


T. gondii has been shown to induce behavioral changes in rodents (increased exploratory behavior, decreased neophobia, and loss of fear of cats) which increase the risk of predation by a feline and thus ultimately benefit the parasite by completing its reproductive cycle.  
Cats are part of the T. gondii story because, in order to complete its life cycle, the parasite must be ingested by a feline (such as a cat). So the theory goes that T. gondii evolved to cause behavior changes in its hosts in order to make them get eaten. If T. gondii infects, say, a mouse, the parasite would only breed if the mouse got eaten by a cat. Reckless mice are more likely to get eaten than cautious ones, the theory goes.  

**30 - 70 % Human Population is estimated to be infected**    
Toxoplasmosis is a very common chronic parasitic infection that is caused by the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) and has an estimated prevalence of 30–70% among human populations worldwide1–4.Most latently infected individuals have traditionally been considered to be clinically asymptomatic
- it is deemed very likely that all infected secondary hosts show an up-regulation of dopamine and display associated behavioral changes  
- a healthy immune system can keep the infection in check, it cannot effectively eliminate the parasite from the brain because neurons lack the MHC class I as well as specific intracellular mechanisms to inhibit parasite growth  
- latent toxoplasmosis usually persist lifelong  

Among other organs, the parasite infects the brain, and it has been blamed for making people more impulsive, and more prone to mental illness, including schizophrenia.  

Sugden et al. examined the Dunedin Longitudinal Study, a sample of over 1,000 people born in New Zealand in 1972-73 and followed up from birth. Sugden et al. tested the participants blood samples, taken at age of 38, for antibodies against T. gondii. Of 837 people who gave blood samples, 28% tested positive, indicating that they were infected with the parasite.  


## Dopamine
Two cognitive domains which have repeatedly been shown to be modulated by dopamine are cognitive control and reward/motivation  

In rodents, T. gondii infection has been associated with a greater tolerance of reward forfeiture, more risk-taking/less risk aversion, and an increased delay aversion for rewards.  
In humans, latent toxoplasmosis has so far only been associated with increased sensation seeking and addiction  
The supposed increase in sensation seeking could indicate that latently infected individuals require more stimulation to feel rewarded. Means they should respond less to rewards.

This article offers the first systematic discussion of brain evolution in light of parasite manipulation  

### Transmission
From“zombieants”to“kamikaze crickets” and “mind-controlling wasps,”the parade of behavior-altering parasites and their victims offers riveting examples of how nervous
systems can be hijacked to serve the interests of hostile organisms.  

In trophic transmission, an intermediate host is manipulated to make it more susceptible to predation by the definitive host (Lafferty 1999). To this end, a parasite may
reduce the host’s avoidance and antipredator behaviors, or even replace avoidance with attraction. A classic example is protozoan Toxoplasma gondii: infected rats lose
their innate aversion to the odor of cats— the definitive host—and may even become attracted to it (this phenomenon has been dubbed “feline attraction”; Berdoy et al. 2000; Ingram et al. 2013; Kaushik et al. 2014). Alternatively or in addition, parasites may induce behaviors that actively lure predators toward the host

Gammarid crustaceans infected by spiny-headed worms become attracted by light (positive phototaxis), and when the water is disturbed they do not respond by escaping; instead, they swim to the surface and cling to a solid object, thus becoming easy prey for birds. When California killifish are infected by the fluke Euhaplorchis californiensis, they begin to display atypical swimming behaviors—such as jerky, conspicuous movements and sudden swims to the surface—that attract bird predators (Adamo 2002, 2013; Lafferty and Shaw 2013). The abdomen of tropical ants infected by the roundworm Myrmeconema neotropicum turns from black to bright red; the ants then climb into patches of red berries and raise
their abdomen to mimic a fruit, thus attracting the frugivorous birds that serve as the parasite’s final host (Yanoviak et al. 2008; for more examples see Poulin 2010; Lafferty
and Shaw 2013; Mehlhorn 2015b).

sexually transmitted parasites can spread more effectively by manipulating aspects of the host’s sexual behavior, including frequency of mating, mate choice selectivity, attractiveness to potential mates, and specific copulatory behaviors

### Movement:
Grasshoppers and crickets infected by horsehair worms begin to seek out water and eventually jump into it, releasing the adult parasite—which can then completeits reproductive cycle—and usually dying in the process (Poulin 2010; Mehlhorn 2015b). Bees infected by larvae of the parasitoid fly Apocephalus borealis fly far away from their hive,
die, and release the larvae as these are ready to pupate
