### Stroke
A stroke occurs when part of the brain loses its blood supply and stops working. This causes the part of the body that the injured brain controls to stop working   
Causes of strokes include ischemia (loss of blood supply) or hemorrhage (bleeding) in the brain.  

You can prevent stroke by quitting smoking, controlling blood pressure, maintaining a healthy weight, eating a healthy diet, and exercising on a regular basis.  

Risen had experienced a stroke that damaged his visual cortex, causing blindness on the right side in both eyes. It’s a common complication, estimated to affect up to 50 percent of people who suffer a stroke, and extremely disorienting  

“Every time I opened my eyes I was reminded that I had a severe visual problem,” Risen says. When walking in crowded areas, people would just pop into sight, as if from nowhere, because he had no ability to detect objects or movement peripherally on the right side. Taking a hike in the woods was out of the question. “I might run into a tree or step in a pothole,” he says.  


### Heart disease, stroke and stress
There are undeniable links between heart disease, stroke and stress. 
Stress can cause the heart to work harder, increase blood pressure, and increase sugar and fat levels in the blood. These things, in turn, can increase the risk of clots forming and travelling to the heart or brain, causing a heart attack or stroke.  

As well, if you feel stressed, it can be hard to lead a healthy lifestyle. Instead of using exercise to relieve stress you might overeat, eat unhealthy foods, drink too much alcohol or smoke. These behaviours, in turn, can increase your risk of developing heart disease and stroke.  

Responding to stress with anger can also make matters worse. Anger increases your heart rate and your blood pressure, putting you at risk of a heart attack. People who are prone to anger are also more likely to turn to unhealthy behaviours.  

Having a serious health event – like a heart attack, stroke or being diagnosed with an illness – can also be stressful. And that stress can slow down the recovery process or even create health problems that weren’t there before.   

### Mini Stroke Symptoms
A ministroke is also known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA). It occurs when part of the brain experiences a temporary lack of blood flow. This causes stroke-like symptoms that resolve within 24 hours  
- People with a ministroke may temporarily find themselves unable to speak or trouble understanding words.  
- Temporary blindness in one eye.  The world turns gray or objects look blurry.  
- Trouble walking, or lack of balance or coordination  
- Confusion or difficulty speaking  
- 

High Blood pressure is one of the common causes  

Symptoms of high blood pressure  
- dizziness
- have a pounding feeling in their head or chest  
- sensation of pulsing or pounding in your ears when you haven’t been exercising vigorously, this could indicate an elevated blood pressure  
- Chest pain  
- changes in mental status: muddled thinking, changes in speech, unusual behavior and even simply reduced activity  
- sudden change in vision — blindness, loss of vision in one eye, changes in part of your field of vision, or perhaps something more subtle  
- suddenly feeling of nausea or start vomiting and there doesn’t seem to be an obvious cause,
