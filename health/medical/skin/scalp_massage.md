### Scalp Oil massage increases serotonin
Scalp massage helps stimulate the nerves and blood vessels beneath the skin while calming the muscle tension around the head. Getting a scalp massage also helps relieve pain by decreasing the tension in neck which in turn may get rid of headaches or migraines. Migraines are sometimes caused by a decreased level in serotonin, and scalp massage may be able to increase the serotonin levels and relieve the pain.

Also, a scalp massage is said to increase the production of serotonin, a chemical  and neurotransmitter in the body, responsible for regulating mood. 

The Touch Research Institute cites multiple studies where massage has resulted in documented improved conditions for people with Anorexia, anxiety, blood pressure depression, fatigue, confusion, migraines, and sleep disturbances.

How does massage actually work all these wonders in our brains and bodies? A deep tissue massage stimulates receptors to different areas in the brain.  It requires the massage therapist to go deeper into the layers of muscle and soft tissue where the stronger connections to the brain are found. When the brain receives these signals from the muscles, neurotransmitters and proteins are released to benefit the endocrine, nervous, and immune systems.  

A study found that Indian Head Massage reduced muscle tension, energised participants, and helped patients deal with negative psychological experiences.

### ASMR
A neurological term which might not be familiar by name is Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR). But if we mention the phrase “head orgasm”, it might ring a bell, or at least grab your attention.

Remember the tingling, pleasurable sensation you feel when the hairdresser massages your scalp? That’s one way in which ASMR is induced.

They’ve called it one of the most powerful wellness techniques. There’s no denying that a head massage is an amazing experience. Just try it. But ASMR is a new sensory phenomenon that uses triggers such as sound and slow movements to generate the tingling sensation.
