1. **Common Triggers of Eczema**:
   - **Heat, Sweat, and Dust**: Primary factors that trigger and aggravate eczema in Singapore, exacerbated by the humid climate.
   - **Dust Mite Allergy**: Significant contributor due to the favorable humid conditions for dust mites.

2. **Causes**:
   - **Genetics**: A leading factor influencing the likelihood of developing eczema.
   - **Immune Dysregulation**: Moderate to severe cases often linked to issues with the immune system.

3. **Severity Statistics**:
   - Moderate and severe cases account for 25% of eczema cases.
     - 15% are moderate.
     - 10% are severe.

4. **Treatment Considerations**:
   - **Immunosuppressants**: While effective, they carry risks of long-term side effects, including:

     - Increased risk of cancers and chronic infections.

5. **Environmental Context**:
   - Singapore's heat and humidity create a challenging environment for eczema management, amplifying the impact of triggers like sweat and dust.



## Humidity 
Both **Singapore** and **Kerala** in India are known for their high humidity due to their tropical climates. However, there are differences in their average humidity levels:

### **1. Singapore**:
- Average Relative Humidity: **70–90%** throughout the year.
- Morning Humidity: Often above **90%**.
- Afternoon Humidity: Usually around **60–70%**, but higher during the rainy season.
- Climate: Consistently humid year-round, with little variation in temperature or weather.

### **2. Kerala, India**:
- Average Relative Humidity: **60–90%**, depending on the season and proximity to water bodies.
- During Monsoons: Humidity often exceeds **85–90%** in many areas.
- Post-Monsoon and Summer: Humidity can drop to **60–70%** in inland areas but stays high near the coast.
- Climate: Tropical with a marked monsoon season and some variation in humidity depending on the region (coastal vs. inland) and time of year.

### **Comparison**:
- **Singapore** generally has **more consistently high humidity** throughout the year due to its equatorial location and lack of seasonal variation.
- **Kerala** experiences **seasonal variations** in humidity, with extremely high humidity during the monsoon but slightly lower averages during drier months.

#### **Conclusion**:
Singapore typically has **higher and more consistent humidity** compared to Kerala, where humidity fluctuates with the seasons and geography.
