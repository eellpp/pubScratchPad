Resting Heart Rate

Generally speaking, when your heart rate decreases, it means that each beat is more effective. A low RHR is a sign of a strong heart muscle that can pump enough blood to supply the body with oxygen without having to labor too hard. When your heart doesnâ€™t need to work as hard to push blood through your body to supply oxygen to your muscles, your level of fitness increases.
