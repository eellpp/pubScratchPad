Arteries get messages from your central nervous system to tighten or open up. This affects your blood pressure, or the force of your blood moving through your arteries. Arteries help keep your blood pressure steady. They also control blood flow. They do both by tightening or loosening their muscle walls.

Roughly 10% of your body’s blood is in your arteries at any point in time.

Your pulmonary artery is the only artery that carries deoxygenated blood. This artery takes blood from your heart to your lungs to get oxygen.

Arteries look like tubes. They have thicker and more muscular walls than veins so they can handle the force of blood coming from your heart’s left ventricle.

Although most people focus on their heart when they think about the cardiovascular system, arteries have an important role, too. They supply your body with oxygen, nutrients and other necessary elements that travel in your blood. When you take care of your arteries, they take care of you. Regular exercise and a diet low in saturated fat can help your arteries keep blood flowing without interruption or slowdowns.

### Simple lifestyle changes/tips to keep arteries healthy

Things you do to keep your heart healthy will also help your arteries. You can:

- Eat a healthy diet that doesn’t include trans fats or saturated fats.
- Get regular exercise.
- Avoid tobacco products.
- Get seven to nine hours of sleep every night (for adults).
- Cope well with stress.
- Get treatment for high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes.
- Stay at a healthy weight.
- Limit how much alcohol you drink.


### How it works
Your arteries carry blood that has oxygen and nutrients in it. Your heart pumps oxygen-rich blood into the biggest artery in your body — your aorta. This branches off into parts that feed smaller and smaller arteries, eventually reaching your entire body.

### Veins vs arteries
Veins carry de-oxygenated blood. (Oxygen poor blood). They Bring blood back to your heart after your body’s cells and tissues have taken the oxygen out of it. Have thinner walls because the pressure inside them isn’t as high as it is in arteries.  

Exercises cause the muscles to swell and harden, which pushes veins toward the surface of the skin. Most cases of veiny arms are harmless.  

Protruding veins in your muscles can be the result of a low body fat percentage and high muscle mass.
