Blood Pressure is the force of your blood on blood vessel walls     
Heart Rate is the number of times your heart beats per minute.   

Blood pressure against the artery wall is created when the ventricles contract to pump blood to the body. 
Increased blood pressure forces the ventricles to work harder to pump the same amount of blood to body. The extra work makes the ventricle wall to thicken and less elastic.  
The thickened, rigid ventricle causes less blood to pumped to the body from heart

**Systolic** blood pressure is the top number and refers to the amount of pressure experienced by the arteries while the heart is beating. 
**Diastolic** blood pressure is the bottom number and refers to the amount of pressure in the arteries while the heart is resting in between heartbeats.

## How to measure
So to get reliable readings, blood pressure is measured on several different days and while you are resting. This means sitting down and relaxing on a chair, and waiting about three minutes before taking a measurement so that your circulatory system comes to rest. The upper arm that is being used for the measurement should rest on a table, at about the same height as the heart, while the reading is being done.

How digital measurement works:   
Digital blood pressure monitors read the blood pressure automatically based on variations in the volume of blood in the arteries. 
When taking blood pressure measurements on the wrist, it's important to keep the hand level with the heart. Otherwise it can affect the readings.


Normal Range is 120/80
- Elivated is 130 and more
- Hyptertension is 140 and more

If you have slightly high blood pressure, your doctor may suggest these steps:

- lose weight if you are overweight,
- get regular physical activity,
- cut down on alcohol, and
- change your food choices to those with less salt and fat

A special eating plan called “DASH” can help you lower your blood pressure. DASH stands for “Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension.” The DASH eating plan emphasizes fruits, vegetables, fat–free or low–fat milk and milk products, whole–grain products, fish, poultry, beans, seeds, and nuts. The DASH eating plan also contains less salt/sodium, sweets, added sugars, sugar containing beverages, fats, and red meats than the typical American diet.

Since fruits and vegetables are naturally lower in sodium than many other foods, DASH makes it easier to lower sodium in the diet. You can also use less salt when you cook and don't bring the salt shaker to the table. Remember, salt/sodium is found in many restaurant and fast-food meals, processed foods, such as soups, convenience meals from the freezer, some breads and cereals, and salted snacks. Your blood pressure is affected by what you eat.


**Diastolic range**
When the diastolic blood pressure is high, the blood vessels will become less elastic, harden and atherosclerotic. Normal diastolic blood pressure usually ranges from 60 to 80 mmHg. If your diastolic blood pressure is 80-89 mmHg, special attention is needed because you already have pre-hypertension. Diastolic pressure usually changes throughout the day.

**Reduce Salt and Increase Pottasium** :
Potassium, on the other hand, is the counter to sodium, helping to flush the mineral out of the body, per the AHA. Potassium also helps to relax blood pressure walls—and more relaxed walls mean lower blood pressure. 
 
Plantains are higher in potassium, magnesium, and vitamin C than bananas. 
- spinach, pomegranate and bananas
- leafy green vegetables


**Exceess fluid in body**
The extra fluid in your body can raise your blood pressure and force your heart to work harder. It can also make it hard for you to breathe. Most of your body is made up of water. The body uses minerals like sodium and potassium to help organs such as your heart, kidneys, and liver balance how much water you need.


**Aerobic exercise** :  
Activities like walking, jogging, swimming, and cycling are excellent for cardiovascular health and blood pressure control.
Strength training:  
Incorporate resistance exercises to build muscle, which can help your body burn calories more efficiently.

**Sleeping** :
People who sleep six hours or less may have steeper increases in blood pressure. If you already have high blood pressure, not sleeping well may make your blood pressure worse. It's thought that sleep helps the body control hormones needed to control stress and metabolism.


**Stress reduction** :  
Chronic stress can contribute to high blood pressure. Practice relaxation techniques like meditation, yoga, or deep breathing to manage stress.


**Limit alcohol** :   
Excessive alcohol consumption can raise blood pressure. If you drink, do so in moderation.

**Maintain a healthy weight** :
Losing excess weight can significantly reduce blood pressure. A combination of a healthy diet and regular exercise is key to achieving and maintaining a healthy weight.

**Intermittant Fasting** :   
Studies have shown a beneficial effect of fasting on lowering blood pressure. Fasting also has benefits on weight, diabetes, and cholesterol. A safe fasting plan should include a discussion with your healthcare provider, plans for any medications you take, and a commitment to staying hydrated and getting enough nutrition.
Monitor your blood pressure:
Regularly check your blood pressure to track your progress and make necessary adjustments to your lifestyle.

16/8 fasting :  
Twice a week : Eat for 8 hours and then fast for 16 hours.   


A 2021 study found that yogurt could help reduce blood pressure due to its high concentration of micronutrients calcium, magnesium and potassium, which are all associated with a lower risk of hypertension.




**Improper Sleep Time** :
irregular sleep schedules can contribute to sleep-deprivation and affect the body’s circadian rhythm. When the circadian rhythm is disturbed, the balance between the body’s ability to react to danger (sympathetic nervous system) and its ability to relax after the danger has passed (parasympathetic nervous system) is disrupted, and BP increases. Circadian disruption can also lead to other adverse health effects such as impaired glucose control, obesity, heart attack, stroke and mood disorders

### Food

A study in the Journal of Hypertension found that consuming about 1 cup of nitrate-rich beet juice could help reduce blood pressure. Nitrate converts to nitric oxide, which in turn helps improve the function of blood vessels by widening the vessels allowing greater blood flow.

A 2023 study in the journal Nutrients found that three or more cups of coffee a day may help lower blood pressure. 


The takeaway
It's important to remember that lifestyle changes take time to show results. Consult with a healthcare professional before making significant changes to your diet or exercise routine, especially if you have underlying health conditions. By incorporating these tips into your daily life, you can take steps to naturally lower your blood pressure and improve your overall well-being.


### How BP medicine works
Blood pressure medicines can work several different ways. Blood pressure medicines can keep blood pressure at a healthy level by1:

- Causing your body to get rid of water, which decreases the amount of water and salt in your body to a healthy level
- Relaxing your blood vessels
- Making your heart beat with less force
- Blocking nerve activity that can restrict your blood vessels
