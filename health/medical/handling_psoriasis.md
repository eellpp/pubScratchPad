Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune condition that causes an overproduction of skin cells. When these cells die, they build up into scaly, white patches.

When the immune system functions properly, it protects the body against any invaders that might make you sick, such as bacteria, viruses or other pathogens. But in people with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, the immune system goes into action even without these outside invaders. Instead, the immune system fights the body’s own tissues. In psoriatic disease, this battle is waged in the skin and joints.

Psoriasis turns your skin cells into type A overachievers: They grow about five times faster than normal skin cells. And your body can't keep up. The old ones pile up instead of sloughing off, making thick, flaky, itchy patches.

When you have psoriasis, the genes that control your immune system signals get mixed up. Instead of protecting your body from invaders as it's designed to do, it promotes inflammation and turns skin cells on overdrive.

### Inflammation and cytokins

Cytokines are signalling molecules.Cytokines are a group of proteins secreted by cells of the immune system that act as chemical messengers. Cytokines also mediate interactions between cells.  
Immune system cells are constantly sending out signals to let other cells know what's going on. To communicate, your immune cells use cytokines, which are a group of proteins secreted by cells of the immune system that act as chemical messengers.  

In the case of infection, inflammation begins when the cells of the innate immune system recognize a pathogen associated with the invading organism. In the first stage of inflammation, the immune cells detect the pathogin and produce cytokins. During the early phase of infection, cytokins act as signals to the immune system, regulating the duration and gravity of the immune response to damage or infection.

Inflammation is a process by which the body's white blood cells and substances they produce protect us from infection with foreign organisms, such as bacteria and viruses, When inflammation occurs, chemicals from the body's white blood cells are released into the blood or affected tissues to protect your body from foreign substances. This release of chemicals increases the blood flow to the area of injury or infection, and may result in redness and warmth. Some of the chemicals cause a leak of fluid into the tissues, resulting in swelling. This protective process may stimulate nerves and cause pain.

Once recognition has occurred and inflammation has been initiated, certain host cells begin to secrete chemokines. Many different types of cells are able to secrete these chemotactic cytokines, including phagocytic cells such as macrophages and neutrophils, though endothelial cells are responsible for over half of all produced. Following recruitment of immune cells to the site of inflammation, resolution of the damage begins.As well as mediating the inflammatory response, proinflammatory cytokines can affect the brain, inducing behavioral and physiological symptoms such as fever, nausea, and anorexia 

The major feature distinguishing cytokines from hormones is the fact that cytokines are not produced by specialized cells organized in specialized glands. Cytokines are secreted proteins which means that their expression sites does not predict where they exert their biological function.They are different from hormones, which are also important cell signaling molecules, in that hormones circulate in higher concentrations and tend to be made by specific kinds of cells.

Cytokines released from one cell affect the actions of other cells by binding to receptors on their surface. You can think of these receptors as mailboxes. They receive the cytokine's chemical message, and then the receiving cell performs activities based on that message.
Role of cytokines is to help regulate the immune response. Cytokines are involved in many aspects of inflammation and immunity. 
when a foreign substance is detected, chemical orders are sent out to immune cells, including various white blood cells. These cells then travel toward the area to eliminate the threat.

Cytokines can be proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory.

### Autoimmune
The body's defense system -- the immune system -- triggers an inflammatory response when there are no foreign invaders to fight off. In these diseases, called autoimmune diseases, the body's normally protective immune system causes damage to its own tissues. The body responds as if normal tissues are infected or somehow abnormal.

A `cytokine storm` is an overproduction of immune cells and their activating compounds (cytokines), which, in a flu infection, is often associated with a surge of activated immune cells into the lungs. The resulting lung inflammation and fluid buildup can lead to respiratory distress and can be contaminated by a secondary bacterial pneumonia -- often enhancing the mortality in patients. Cytokine storm is now seen as a likely major cause of mortality in the 1918-20 "Spanish flu" -- which killed more than 50 million people worldwide -- and the H1N1 "swine flu" and H5N1 "bird flu" of recent years. In these epidemics, the patients most likely to die were relatively young adults with apparently strong immune reactions to the infection.
The treatment for these diseases is to reduce the immune over-reaction by dampning the immune system.
You should also rest, drink plenty of fluids and continue to eat, Poland said. Flu sufferers who remain active are adding to the body-wide inflammation caused by cytokines,

This attack is carried out by cytokines, which are proteins that help control the immune system’s inflammatory response. Cytokines trigger inflammation, causing the blood vessels to expand and send more immune cells to different parts of the body. In psoriasis, this inflammation happens in the skin, leading to the red, itchy and scaly patches known as plaques. In psoriatic arthritis, this inflammation happens inside the body, leading to swollen and painful joints and tendons.

Flu virus infecting the lungs can directly cause shortness of breath, fever and pneumonia, Poland added.But many deaths caused by flu occur due to a "cytokine storm" -- an overwhelming flood of immune chemicals prompted by first exposure to a new and dangerous influenza virus.The body is so massively activated in an attempt to fight off this virus that it releases too many of these internal chemicals. People treating flu symptoms most often are treating the inflammation produced by cytokine release. That's why nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like aspirin and ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) are recommended.

As physicians we are trained to shut off inflammation with aspirin, anti-inflammatory medication such as Advil or Motrin, steroids, and increasingly more powerful immune suppressing medication with serious side effects.

Specific diets can casuse auto-immune response. Like eating cold yougurt in cloudy weather condition can create autoimmune reaction where body produces phlegm even though no virus is present. 
Patient can cure autoimmune disease by finding and eliminating the causes of inflammation in his diet and environment.

Autoimmune diseases include rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, celiac disease, thyroid disease, and the many other hard-to-classify syndromes in the 21st century.

Autoimmune disorders occur almost exclusively in developed countries.If you grew up on a farm with lots of animals, you are also less likely to have any of these inflammatory disorders. Playing in the dirt, being dirty, and being exposed to bugs and infections trains your immune system to recognize what is foreign and what is “you.”

 hunting for toxins, allergens, and infections — all common causes of inflammation

Taking care of immune system:
- Try to minimize stress
- Don't smoke.
- Eat a diet high in fruits and vegetables.
- Exercise regularly. 30 min everday
- Maintain a healthy weight.
- If you drink alcohol, drink only in moderation.
- Get adequate sleep.
- Take steps to avoid infection, such as washing your hands frequently and cooking meats thoroughly.


Psoriasis is more than skin deep. Those thick, scaly patches are only what you see on the surface. Deep inside your body, there’s a battle raging.

Experts believe psoriasis is an autoimmune disease. That means your body thinks its own tissues are foreign invaders that must be attacked. It also means that, unlike a simple rash, you can’t get rid of it with an over-the-counter skin treatment.

In fact, there’s no cure for psoriasis. The disease is chronic and relapsing, which means you’ll have it long-term but symptoms may come and go.

With psoriasis, your T cells (a type of white blood cell) become highly active and attack skin cells by mistake. Then other parts of your immune system spring into action. Inflammation happens, and skin cells grow too fast.

What’s “too fast”? In healthy people, new skin cells normally travel from deep within the skin to the surface of the skin in about a month. The process is called cell turnover. With psoriasis, new skin cells rise to the surface within days. The rapid cell turnover leads to thick patches of skin.


#### Skin Psoriasis is tied with positic arthritis
Some research shows that around 30% of people, when diagnosed with psoriasis, already have PsA, a disease that affects joints and the areas where tissue attaches to bone.

### Stress
Scientists think your immune system may respond to emotional and mental pressures the same way it does to physical problems like injuries and infections.

### Skin Barrier
The skin barrier, or skin barrier function, is essentially the outermost layer of skin cells (the stratum corneum, if you’re fancy) plus the lipid matrix (composed of ceramides, cholesterols and fatty acids) that holds those cells together. You can think of the skin barrier like a brick wall: The cells are the bricks, and the lipid matrix is the mortar. Altogether, it functions as a crucial protective barrier from environmental irritants and harmful microbes—but it’s also highly permeable and delicate.

Basically, the skin barrier is responsible for maintaining skin hydration, softness and firmness. It also keeps potentially damaging chemicals and irritants out. 

If you’ve ever noticed your skin has gotten inflamed, flaky, sensitive or dry seemingly out of the blue, you might have a compromised skin barrier.

### The role of inflammation
Inflammation is one of the weapons used by the immune system to fight an invader. For example, when you catch a virus or develop a bacterial infection, a type of immune cell called a T-cell springs into action. When T-cells recognize something as an antigen, they begin an inflammatory attack against the invader.
