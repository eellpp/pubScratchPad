### Tension Headache
A tension headache is the most common type of headache. It can cause mild, moderate, or intense pain behind your eyes and in your head and neck. Some people say that a tension headache feels like a tight band around their forehead. Most people who experience tension headaches have episodic headaches.Tension headache occurs when muscles of the scalp and neck become tense, such as from tension, stress, fear, and/or emotions.  

### Migraine Headache
A migraine is a headache that can cause severe throbbing pain or a pulsing sensation, usually on one side of the head. It's often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and extreme sensitivity to light and sound. Neck pain associated with migraines are common and may start before the migraine attack or occur during a migraine attack.

### Cluster Headache
Cluster headaches, which occur in cyclical patterns or cluster periods, are one of the most painful types of headache. A cluster headache commonly awakens you in the middle of the night with intense pain in or around one eye on one side of your head. The headache is typically felt on one side of the head or around one eye, causing deep burning or piercing pain. Nasal congestion may accompany the pain, and the nose or affected eye may become swollen or red.

Cluster headaches occur suddenly, almost always cause symptoms on one side of the head, and are accompanied by a runny nose and tearing eye on the same side of the head as the headache. For this reason, cluster headaches are often confused with sinus headaches, Diamond says, though their pain is distinct.

“Cluster headaches feel like someone put a hot poker or sword through your eye,” she says.  

 Cluster headaches can be more severe than a migraine, but they usually don't last as long.  
 Cluster headaches usually last only 30 to 90 minutes. They can be as short as 15 minutes or as long as 3 hours, but then they disappear.

### Cervicogenic Headache
Cervicogenic headache usually begins as a dull ache in the neck and radiates upward along the back of the head, almost always one sided. Pain may also spread to the forehead, temple, and area around the eyes and/or ears. CGH is caused due to an underlying disc, joint, muscle, or nerve disorder in the neck.  

### Occipital Neuraliga Headache
Occipital neuralgia is characterized by sharp, painful, electric-shock-like sensations on the back of the head, neck, and ears. The pain is typically one-sided and begins in the upper neck and spreads to the head. Occipital neuralgia is caused due to irritation or injury to the occipital nerve.

### Temporomandibular (TMJ) Headache
TMJ headache is a dull ache starting at the temples and around the TMJ and may resemble an earache.
