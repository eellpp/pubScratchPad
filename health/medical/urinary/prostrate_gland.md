### How does the prostate work?
The prostate is a gland about the size of a chestnut and weighs about 30 grams (about 1 ounce). It is part of the male reproductive system and is located inside the body. The prostate’s most important function is the production of a fluid that, together with sperm cells from the testicles and fluids from other glands, makes up semen. The muscles of the prostate also ensure that the semen is forcefully pressed into the urethra and then expelled outwards during ejaculation.

The prostate is located directly below the bladder and above the muscles of the pelvic floor. The rectum is behind the prostate, making it possible to feel the gland from the rectum using the finger. The ducts in the prostate gland flow into the urethra, which passes through the prostate. The word “prostate” is taken from the Greek expression meaning “one who stands before,” which describes the position of the prostate gland. Viewed from below, where the urethra leaves the gland, the prostate “stands before” the bladder.

 During ejaculation these muscle cells contract and forcefully press the fluid that has been stored in the prostate out into the urethra. This causes the fluid and the sperm cells, together with fluid from other glands, to combine to form semen, which is then released.

### What is benign prostatic hyperplasia?
Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is also called benign prostatic hypertrophy. It’s when the prostate gland becomes very large and may cause problems passing urine. BPH is not cancer, and is a common part of aging.  

The cause of BPH is not known. The prostate goes through 2 main periods of growth. In early puberty, it doubles in size. Then around age 25, the prostate starts to grow again. It continues to grow for most of a man's life.

The continuing growth of the prostate may not cause problems until much later in life, when the second period of growth may result in BPH. It is a common problem for men starting in their 60s. And it is more likely for men in their 70s and 80s to have some symptoms of BPH.


As the prostate grows, it presses against the urethra, the tube that carries urine out of the body. This interferes with urination. At the same time, the bladder wall becomes thicker and irritated, and begins to contract, even when it contains only small amounts of urine. This can cause more frequent urination. These changes cause the bladder muscle to weaken. It may not empty fully and can leave some urine behind. This leads to symptoms.

The following are the most common symptoms of BPH:

- Leaking or dribbling of urine
- Trouble starting urine stream
- More frequent urination, especially at night
- Urgency to urinate
- Holding urine (can't pass urine)
- An interrupted, weak stream of urine


These problems may lead to one or more of the following if BPH is not treated:  
- Loss of urine control
- Kidney damage
- Blood in the urine
- Bladder damage
- Urinary tract infections
- Bladder stones
I- nability to pass urine at all



#### What happens to sperm that is not ejaculated
There is a system of tiny tubes in the testicles. These tubes, called the seminiferous tubules, house the germ cells. Hormones — including testosterone, the male sex hormone — cause them to turn into sperm. The germ cells divide and change until they resemble tadpoles with a head and short tail. The tails push the sperm into a tube behind the testes called the epididymis.   

The process of going from a germ cell to a mature sperm cell capable of egg fertilization takes around 2.5 months

Sperm made in the testis go into the head (caput) of the epididymis, go through the body (corpus) and stop at the tail (cauda), where they are stored.  
Epididymal transit takes about 2.5 months in humans (longer in other species), but the sperm can be stored in the cauda for 2–3 days. During their transit in the epididymis, sperm undergo maturation processes necessary for them to acquire motility and fertility  When a male ejaculates, fluid from the seminal vesicles joins the sperm to make semen. If a male does not ejaculate sperm, the body eventually breaks down and reabsorbs them. 

Healthy testes make sperm at the rate of between 1000 and 5000 sperm cells per second. These collect in a long coil of tubes above and behind each testicle called the epididymis, where they are stored until needed. In the epididymis the sperm are nourished and make their way to the vas deferens, which is a muscular tube connecting the testis to the urethra up inside the male body. When sperm are ejaculated they are pushed along the vas deferens by rhythmic contractions of the musculature. Once inside the body, secretions from the prostate gland and seminal vesicles are added, producing the semen that is ejaculated from the penis. 

However, although they can survive there for quite a long period within the male anatomy, a fraction of the sperm that are made are never ejaculated. Instead, they will senesce and are broken down.Sperm that have reached their sell-by-date get broken down in the same way that, let's say, blood cells get broken down. And, basically, any of the nutrients and goodies in the sperm just get recycled back inside the body, and new sperm are produced to make up for the shortage.  
The turnover time for sperm produced in the testes and not ejaculated is days to weeks.
