Most of these problems can be avoided by improving bowel habits. Adequate fiber intake with 30 g to 40 g daily is important for many reasons, including improving the quality of stool and preventing colorectal and anal diseases.  


### Hemorrhoid treatment
Dramatic relief for most hemorrhoid symptoms can be found with simple, home remedies for hemorrhoids. To avoid occasional flare-ups, try the following.

**Get more fiber**  
Add more fiber to your diet from food, a fiber supplement (such as Metamucil, Citrucel, or Fiber Con), or both. Along with adequate fluid, fiber softens stools and makes them easier to pass, reducing pressure on hemorrhoids. High-fiber foods include broccoli, beans, wheat and oat bran, whole-grain foods, and fresh fruit. Fiber supplements help decrease hemorrhoidal bleeding, inflammation, and enlargement. They may also reduce irritation from small bits of stool that are trapped around the blood vessels. Some people find that boosting fiber causes bloating or gas. Start slowly, and gradually increase your intake to 25–30 grams of fiber per day. Also, increase your fluid intake.

 When food moves through your colon slowly, too much water can be taken out of it. That makes for a hard, dry stool.
 
 Track and eat fibre in each food you eat. Avoid taking anything without mixing it with fiberous food.
 
- Drink lot of warm water. At least 20 minutes before, or 1 hour after eating. Inadequate hydration is linked to constipation.
- before sleep drink a cup of milk with teaspoon of ghee  
- Eat Papaya. Tested and proven for constipation relief. Also eating a papaya daily will prolong the process and may make you look 5 years younger than you are. Papaya is rich in Vitamin C, Vitamin E and antioxidants like beta-carotene which helps prevent your skin from free radical damage keeping wrinkles and other signs of ageing at bay. https://github.com/eellpp/pubScratchpad/blob/master/health/food/papaya.md  
- chia seeds : Chia seeds are a favorite source of fiber of mine, and with 10 grams per ounce, they help to add bulk to your gut," says Alpert. When chia seeds absorb water, they form a gel-like consistency, which can help make your stool more moist and easy to pass  
- leafy green vegetables  
- Apple is another fiberous food

**Avoid**
- Salt in moderation. Salt absorbs water which makes it harder for stools to move around. Avoid fried salty snacks
- Fried snacks have no fibre. This causes issues
- Eat eggs with source of fibre like leafy vegetables/tomatoes etc.
- Use whole grain toast instead of white bread. Low fibre white flour causes constipation

**Vegetables high in fibre**
- Carrots, beets, and broccoli are fiber-rich.  

### Health Benefits of Insoluble Fiber

Insoluble fiber prevents constipation and complications such as hemorrhoids by bulking up the stool, helping it pass more quickly through the intestines. Insoluble fiber may also help decrease the risk for colorectal cancer by speeding up waste’s movement through the digestive tract. The shorter the amount of time waste spends in your body, the less of chance there is for harmful substances to pass through your intestinal walls into the bloodstream.

- Cooked cauliflower is more than a great side dish; it’s also rich in insoluble fiber. Just one cup contains almost four grams! Note that while raw cauliflower also contains insoluble fiber, the amount almost doubles when you cook it.
- You already know dark greens are good for you, but did you know they can aid digestion as well? Cooked spinach contains between four and five grams of insoluble fiber per cup, and cooked chard has at least three grams.  
- Many nuts make good sources of insoluble fiber. Almonds, for example, have more than 14 grams per cup, and pine nuts, 13 grams per cup. Reach for pistachios or peanuts, too. Both have over 10 grams of insoluble fiber per cup
-  Apple eaten with the skin on, a single apple contains almost three grams. 
- whole grains. Instead of white flour
- brown rice

**Exercise**   
Moderate aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking 20–30 minutes a day, can help stimulate bowel function.

**Dont take time** 
When you feel the urge to defecate, go to the bathroom immediately; don't wait until a more convenient time. Stool can back up, leading to increased pressure and straining. Also, schedule a set time each day, such as after a meal, to sit on the toilet for a few minutes. This can help you establish a regular bowel habit.

**Sitz**  
A sitz bath is a warm water bath for the buttocks and hips (the name comes from the German "sitzen," meaning "to sit"). It can relieve itching, irritation, and spasms of the sphincter muscle. Pharmacies sell small plastic tubs that fit over a toilet seat, or you can sit in a regular bathtub with a few inches of warm water. Most experts recommend a 20-minute sitz bath after each bowel movement and two or three times a day in addition. Take care to gently pat the anal area dry afterward; do not rub or wipe hard. You can also use a hair dryer to dry the area.

**Seek topical relief for hemorrhoids**  
Over-the-counter hemorrhoid creams containing a local anesthetic can temporarily soothe pain. Witch hazel wipes (Tucks) are soothing and have no harmful effects. A small ice pack placed against the anal area for a few minutes can also help reduce pain and swelling. Finally, sitting on a cushion rather than a hard surface helps reduce the swelling of existing hemorrhoids and prevents the formation of new ones.

### Important history questions:
How often do you have a bowel movement?  
What is the quality and consistency of the bowel movement (ie, hard, soft, watery)?  
How long do you sit on the toilet?  
Do you read or play games on your phone while having a bowel movement?  
Do you have anal pain/bleeding/incontinence to stool or gas?  
How do you clean the area? Do you use any wipes or ointments?  
Do you currently take a fiber supplement? If yes, which type and how much?  

### Good Practices
Don’t sit on the toilet for more than a few minutes  
Don't put off the urge to go to the toilet  
To help relieve anal pain and discomfort, sit in a shallow bath of warm water for 10 – 20 minutes, several times a day, if possible
