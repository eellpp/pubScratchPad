To prevent the recurrence of Achilles tendinitis, itâ€™s important to strengthen the muscles in your calves and feet   

Stretching your calves is also key for prevention. One of the best stretches for the Achilles is also the simplest. Stand on the balls of your feet on stairs, a curb, or a low rung of a ladder. Drop both heels down and hold for 10 seconds. To increase the intensity of the stretch, keep one foot flat and lower the other heel. Then switch legs.

improving your running form by shortening your stride and quickening your cadence to avoid heel-striking too heavily.

One common culprit is tightness in the calf muscles. Stretch your calves or roll them out with a foam roller. Be sure to roll the muscles and not the tendon area  
Avoid massaging the tendon. Massage the calf muscles
