You gradually begin losing muscle mass and strength sometime in your 30s or 40s. This process picks up between the ages of 65 and 80. Rates vary, but you may lose as much as 8% of your muscle mass each decade. Everyone loses muscle mass over time, but people with sarcopenia lose it more quickly.

Sarcopenia is the age-related progressive loss of muscle mass and strength. The main symptom of the condition is muscle weakness. 


You may not be able to completely prevent sarcopenia since the condition happens as part of the natural aging process. But you can take steps to slow the progression of the disease. These include:

- Make healthy food choices: Maintain a healthy diet that includes high-quality proteins. Aim for 20 to 35 grams of protein in each meal.
- Exercise: Maintain a physically active lifestyle that includes exercises such as resistance training.
- Routine physicals: See your healthcare provider regularly, and let them know about any changes in your health.

### Risk Factors for sarcopeia

- Physical inactivity.
- Obesity.
- Chronic diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), kidney disease, diabetes, cancer and HIV.
- Rheumatoid arthritis.
- Insulin resistance.
- Reduction in hormone levels.
- Malnutrition or inadequate protein intake.
= Decrease in your ability to convert protein to energy.
- Decline in the number of nerve cells that send messages from your brain to your muscles telling them to move.

### Muscle strength tests

**Handgrip test** : Handgrip strength draws a parallel to the strength in your other muscles. Providers use it to identify shortages in overall muscle strength.

**Chair stand test** : Providers use the chair stand test to measure your leg muscle strength, especially your quadriceps. The chair stand test measures the number of times you can stand and sit from a chair without the use of your arms in 30 seconds.  

**Walking speed test** : The walking (gait) speed test measures the time it takes for you to travel 4 meters (about 13 feet) at your usual walking pace.

**Short physical performance battery (SPPB)** : With the SPPB test, you take three timed tasks: chair stand test, standing balance test and walking speed test.  

**Timed-up and go test (TUG)** : The TUG test measures the time it takes for you to rise from a chair, walk 3 meters (about 10 feet) away from the chair, walk 3 meters back to the chair, and sit back down in the chair.
