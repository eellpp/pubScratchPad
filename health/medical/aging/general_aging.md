### Poor People Age Faster Because Of Hormone Imbalance 
For poor people, the hormones required for healthy aging becomes imbalanced by the time they turned 60 to 64 years old  
A person's societal and economic conditions can greatly affect his/her hormonal levels.  
Hormones may be affected by exposure across life to stress and adverse events, health problems and obesity, and unhealthy lifestyles such as physical inactivity, poor diet, and smoking  
The stress of having a less secure future, being bossed around, less access to social support networks, and having lower self-esteem may also increase psychological harm in those who are poor.  
Whether you are rich or poor, your mindset can help accelerate the aging process faster  
People who are happier tend to look younger-looking, experts said. These people also tend to live longer with fewer health problems
