### Leaky Gut
In leaky gut syndrome, gaps in the intestinal walls allow bacteria and other toxins to pass into the bloodstream. Tight openings in the intestinal walls allow water and nutrients to pass through into the bloodstream while keeping harmful substances inside. In LGS, these openings become wider, allowing food particles, bacteria, and toxins to enter directly into the bloodstream.

Leaky gut symptoms  
Leaky gut may cause or contribute to the following symptoms:  

- chronic diarrhea, constipation, or bloating
- nutritional deficiencies
- fatigue
- headaches
- confusion
- difficulty concentrating
- skin problems, such as acne, rashes, or eczema
- joint pain
- widespread inflammation

### Foods to eat
As leaky gut syndrome isnâ€™t an official medical diagnosis, there is no recommended treatment.

Yet, you can do plenty of things to improve your general digestive health.

One is to eat a diet rich in foods that aid the growth of beneficial gut bacteria. An unhealthy collection of gut bacteria has been linked to poor health outcomes, including chronic inflammation, cancers, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes (18Trusted Source).

The following foods are great options for improving your digestive health:

`Vegetables`: broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, arugula, carrots, kale, eggplant, beetroot, Swiss chard, spinach, ginger, mushrooms, and zucchini
Roots and tubers: potatoes, sweet potatoes, yams, carrots, squash, and turnips  
`Fermented vegetables`: kimchi, sauerkraut, tempeh, and miso  
`Fruit`: coconut, grapes, bananas, blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, kiwi, pineapple, oranges, mandarin, lemon, limes, passionfruit, and papaya  
`Sprouted seeds`: chia seeds, flax seeds, sunflower seeds, and more  
`Gluten-free grains`: buckwheat, amaranth, rice (brown and white), sorghum, teff, and gluten-free oats  
`Healthy fats`: avocado, avocado oil, coconut oil, and extra virgin olive oil  
`Fish`: salmon, tuna, herring, and other omega-3-rich fish  
`Meats and eggs`: lean cuts of chicken, beef, lamb, turkey, and eggs  
`Herbs and spices`: all herbs and spices  
`Cultured dairy products`: kefir, yogurt, Greek yogurt, and traditional buttermilk
`Beverages`: bone broth, teas, coconut milk, nut milk, water, and kombucha
`Nuts`: raw nuts, including peanuts, almonds, and nut-based products, such as nut milks

### Foods to avoid
Avoiding certain foods is equally important for improving your gut health.

Some foods have been shown to cause inflammation in your body, which may promote the growth of unhealthy gut bacteria that are linked to many chronic diseases (19Trusted Source).

The following list contains foods that may harm healthy gut bacteria, as well as some that are believed to trigger digestive symptoms, such as bloating, constipation, and diarrhea:

`Wheat-based products`: bread, pasta, cereals, wheat flour, couscous, etc.  
`Gluten-containing grains`: barley, rye, bulgur, seitan, triticale, and oats  
`Processed meats`: cold cuts, deli meats, bacon, hot dogs, etc.  
`Baked goods`: cakes, muffins, cookies, pies, pastries, and pizza  
`Snack foods`: crackers, muesli bars, popcorn, pretzels, etc.  
`Junk food`: fast foods, potato chips, sugary cereals, candy bars, etc.
