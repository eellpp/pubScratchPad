- limiting sun exposure,  
- cleaning the oil/dirt,  
- using something to maintain hydration (mositurizers) 


Wash face each night before bed with warm water. Use the washcloth once, then wash in 95c water  

Moisturise face after shower with beard oil. Water-based moisturisers don't last.

Use gentle face wash instead of soap  

Ideally you should be washing your face twice a day (once in the morning and once at night) as well as after workouts or any other excessive sweating   

Prevent UV rays damaging the skin.UVA doesn't cause tanning or sunburn, but it does pass through clouds and damages the skin  

### Cleaning with coconut oil
"unrefined" or "virgin" coconut oil  

Step 1: Put coconut oil into the palm of your hand
Step 2: Warm the oil up in your hands by rubbing your hands back and forth
Step 3: Gently massage the oil into your face using small, circular strokes for 1 minute
Step 4: Rinse a washcloth under very warm water, wring out the excess water, and let the cloth sit on your face for 30 seconds
Step 5: Gently wipe the oil off of your face with the wash cloth
Step 6: Repeat step 4 and step 5 if necessary
Step 7: Admire your clean and moisturized face in the mirror  

Dry skin types might benefit best from the protection that coconut oil provides.
