1. Catabolism refers to the exergonic process by which energy released by the breakdown of organic compounds such as glucose can be used to synthesize ATP, the form of energy required to do cellular work.  
2. Anabolism is the endergonic process that uses the energy stored in ATP to synthesize the building blocks of the macromolecules that make up the cell.  
3. Precursor metabolites are intermediate molecules in catabolic and anabolic pathways that can be either oxidized to generate ATP or can be used to synthesize macromolecular subunits such as amino acids, lipids, and nucleotides.  
4. Cellular respiration is the process cells use to convert the energy in the chemical bonds of nutrients to ATP energy.  
5. Aerobic respiration is an exergonic pathway that requires molecular oxygen (O2).  
6. Anaerobic exergonic pathways do not require oxygen and include anaerobic respiration and fermentation.  

Catabolism is the set of metabolic processes that break down large molecules. These include breaking down and oxidizing food molecules.  Inside cells during glycosis the glucose is converted to pyruvate and some ATP is generated. Carbon dioxide is released as waste product.  

In the absence of oxygen, some cells are able to make ATP by the anaerobic catabolism of glucose.  

anaerobic glycolysis and anaerobic metabolism, both of which occur during strenuous exercise

Anabolism and catabolism are parts of your metabolism  
When you’re in an anabolic state, you’re building and maintaining your muscle mass. When you’re in a catabolic state, you’re breaking down or losing overall mass, both fat and muscle.  

Anabolism requires energy to grow and build. Catabolism uses energy to break down.  

In anabolic state small, simple molecules are built up into larger, more complex ones. Catabolism is what happens when you digest food and the molecules break down in the body for use as energy.  

Different hormones in the body are associated with either anabolism and catabolism.  

Anabolism involves the hormones:
- estrogen
- insulin
- growth hormone
- testosterone
- melatonin

Catabolism involves the hormones:
- adrenaline
- cortisol
- cytokines
- glucagon

Both the anabolic and catabolic process lead to fat loss over time.  

#### Catabolic Exercises
Catabolic exercises are aerobic, or cardio, exercises. They may include moves — like running, swimming, and biking — where you’re in a steady active state for a relatively long period of time.   
Your heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration all rise during catabolic exercise. The body breaks down glycogen during your sweat sessions to use as fuel. When you run out of carbohydrate stores, your body’s cortisol uses amino acids to create energy.   
catabolic exercises may help you build a healthy heart and lungs.   
 It effectively breaks down muscle over time. Some of this muscle may be rebuilt during sleep or rest of eight hours or more through spontaneous anabolic processes.  

#### Anabolic Exercises
If you’re looking to build muscle, being in a catabolic state for too long can work against you. It can decrease your muscle mass and even compromise your overall health. Muscle can be maintained by training three or four days a week

- Pull ups
- Dumbbell hammer curl
- standing dumbbell shoulder press
- one arm dumbbell row
- inclined bench press
- front squat
- romanian deadlift

Unless otherwise noted, perform each exercise in 3 sets of 15 repetitions, working down to 12 and then 8 repetitions. Overall, to stay in an anabolic state and maintain your muscle mass, you must train this way regularly.
