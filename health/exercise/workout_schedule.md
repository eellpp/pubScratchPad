### Rules
- Keep monitoring the body experience and take assessment weekly on any adjustments. Take log of it
- Observe the body

When i was running long distance for quite some time, after a while i was not feeling so good. My body was already acclimatized to it, and i could barely notice any feeling after running 6 /7 K . Then i started sprint and stop. Sprint as fast as possible for 30 sec and then jog very slowly for next 30 sec. Did it for distance of 3 Km, in around 8 to 10 iteration. This made me really out of breadth, sweaty and tired. Followed this as my running strategy and it for 8 months. Soon again noticed that i not feeling it that well. Though i am getting out of breadth but not sweaty and tired. Then one fine day i ran at moderate speed for 5K+. This really made me sweat. Even though i was not out of breadth, i was feeling the blood flow through the body and sense of exhilaralation that i haven't felt of long time.  

### Lesson learnt: Mix and Match
- Some days do moderate speed 5K 
- Some days HIT sprint and jog for 3K
- Once a while every month, do a slow 8K
