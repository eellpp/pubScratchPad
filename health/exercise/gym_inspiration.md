### Effort together with intelligence is holy grail

- You have to take from the body which it wont give easily
- Everyday push hard to do something which you have not done before. That is training hard. Break your best. 
- Compete with yourself. Beat yourself everday. Better yourself everyday. 
- It ain't going to be easy. You need to grab it. It wont be given
- effort with intelligence is when things happen. Emotional burst is not going to take you long. Need to have a plan and have effort to match that plan. Without smart planning you are going to break down your body. 

Push. Improve. Push for something that you have not done before.

### Keep pushing hard
Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistance and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan press on will always keep solving the problems of human race. - Calvin Coolidge , US president
