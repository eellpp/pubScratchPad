### Excess fat related to diabetes and hyptertesion  
An increase in body fat in many individuals and populations directly increases the risk of metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension and dyslipidaemia (2). These are the most common metabolic diseases encountered in endocrine practice, and might also be considered epidemics.  
Fat weight gain often results in pathologic adipose tissue dysfunction, accounting for the onset or worsening of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension  

### Fat affects Immune System
Body fat used to be thought of as inert, a form of storage. But scientists now know that the tissue is biologically active, producing hormones and immune-system proteins that act on other cells, promoting a state of nagging low-grade inflammation even when there is no infection.  

Inflammation is the body’s response to an invader, and sometimes it can be so vigorous that it is more harmful than the infection that triggered it. “The more fat mass, and in particular visceral fat mass, the worse your inflammatory response,” Dr. McLaughlin said, referring to the abdominal fat that surrounds internal organs.

Fat tissue is composed mostly of fat cells, or adipocytes. It also contains pre-adipocytes, which mature into fat cells, and a variety of immune cells, including a type called adipose tissue macrophages. 

The coronavirus “can infect that tissue and actually reside there,” he said. “Whether it hurts it, kills it or at best, it’s a place to amplify itself — it doesn’t matter. It becomes kind of a reservoir.”

As the inflammatory response snowballs, cytokines trigger even more inflammation and the release of additional cytokines. “It’s like a perfect storm,” he said
