Aerobic vs. Anaerobic Exercise: Which Is Best for Weight Loss?  

For most people, extended periods of aerobic exercise are needed to achieve significant fat loss  

In any given workout, you’re burning a combination of fat and carbs. It takes longer to convert fat into energy than it does carbs.  
Carbs only have 4 calories worth of energy per gram, whereas fat has 9 calories per gram. As you run out of energy from carbs, you start utilizing fat reserves.  

If you perform 30 minutes of low-intensity aerobic exercise and burn 200 total calories, about 120 of those (60%) will come from fat. Exercising for the same amount of time at a high intensity will burn approximately 400 total calories and 140 of those (35%) will come from fat.  
Even though fewer calories come from fat during anaerobic exercise, more total calories were burned at the high intensity and more overall fat was actually burned.  
So if you’re looking to burn a high amount of fat in a shorter period of time, anaerobic exercise is the most efficient.  
But still, it’s good to mix up your workout…a good mixture of aerobic and anaerobic exercise will ensure you’re burning calories from both carbs and fat.
