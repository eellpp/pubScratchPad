[Sprinting Technique - Sprint Faster with a Proper Foot Strike](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ot-dP1xST4)

### Land on middle feet
A common mistake many sprinters make is striking the ground on their toes resulting in massive ankle amortization and increased ground contact times. The goal of these drills is to get the athlete to develop a flat foot strike by overemphasizing landing flat on the heel. The result will be a flat foot strike during sprinting (landing on the forefoot or where the track spikes are).  

### [A Complete Guide To Proper Sprinting Form](https://xpollinationproductions.com/proper-sprinting-form/)

Sprinting isn’t just “running faster.” Sprinting is about applying the maximum amount of force down to the ground.

But you can change your technique and training to maximize your individual potential and get faster.

### Upper Body Posture
During upright sprinting the posture should be tall with the head, neck and shoulders directly on top of the hips. Anything more than a very slight forward lean will move everything out of position.

The shoulders are relaxed and down.

### Arm Action
Instead of locking the elbows and arms in a fixed position, they should work in harmony with what the legs are doing. The arms move front to back (or on the sagittal plane) with virtually no movement side to side.

They should also be relatively free of tension and loose. Don’t make fists or flex the arms. Tightness in the arms will flow to the legs and slow you down.
The hand should be blocked around shoulder height (meaning it does not extend pass this point).

The action of the arm should be a 1 stroke movement. Once the hand reaches shoulder height, strike down and back with the arm. As soon as ground contact is made with the foot, the hand should swing past the hips with the elbow near complete extension (almost straight).  

This arm movement will also cause a stretch in the chest and shoulder. This stretch creates “an elastic energy return” of the arm back to the front of the body. This means less effort is required to drive the arm forward to the starting ‘blocking position’ of shoulder height. 

### Lower Body Posture
To sprint fast you need to have the foot land directly underneath the center of mass. Think of stepping over the knee and driving the foot straight down into the track.  
Many athletes make the mistake of trying to cover more ground by lengthening their stride. This is a mistake and should avoided at all costs.  
Over-striding or “reaching” is a killer when it comes to sprinting. The reason is because when you reach out for a longer stride you are going against your inertia. It’s like putting on the brakes every time your foot hits the ground.

Each stride will also be less powerful if it lands in front of the body. 

Instead focus on pushing down to the track or ground with a neutral pelvis. Watch where the foot lands in relation to the body in the video below. 

### Leg Movement
The lead leg should follow a 2 stroke movement. 

The first movement is up to form the “ hard Z.” (see video below). The foot is behind the knee and the calf is close to the hamstring. This is much faster than an “L” position where the calf is perpendicular to the ground.

The second movement is an active strike directly down to the ground. As soon as you hit the “hard Z” immediately explode down to the ground. Don’t wait.

Just changing this single element of your sprinting form should have a sizable impact on your speed.

Fast sprinters spend less time on the ground with each stride vs slower ones. A big part of that is achieved through an active strike to the ground.
