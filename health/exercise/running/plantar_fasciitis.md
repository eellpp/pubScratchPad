Plantar fasciitis sufferers feel a sharp stab or deep ache in the heel or along the arch of the foot   
You feel pain as soon as you put your foot on the ground in the morning.   
The pain can recur after long spells of sitting, but it tends to fade during a run once the area is warmed up.   

Exercise:   
- foam rolling or self massage 
- stretching (particularly the plantar fascia itself, but also the calves) can help to alleviate the aches associated with the condition  
- Shoes with arch support. And keep in mind that walking around barefoot or in flimsy shoes can delay recovery

Strengthening the muscles in your midfoot with barefoot exercises and experimenting with your running style by shortening your stride and quickening your cadence can also help. 

stretch the plantar fascia and Achilles tendon to loosen them up. While itâ€™s typical to experience pain in just one foot, massage and stretch both feet. Do it first thing in the morning and three times during the day.
