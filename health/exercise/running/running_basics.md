#### Knee pain after running
If you land on your heels, you are stopping your forward momentum and causing undue stress on your knees. 

#### Shin Splits
Landing on your toes causes your calves to do too much work, which can lead to shin splints. 

Running on your toes can also lead to bouncing

### How to Change Your Footstrike
Despite the tension between the traditional view and newer ideas, you might decide that you want to change your footstrike. You can't change your footstrike overnight, but you can work to gradually work towards landing mid-sole. If you're a heel-striker or toe-striker, here are some tips to try to (gradually) change your footstrike:

1. Be careful that you're not overstriding. Make sure that you don't lunge forward with your feet. Focus on landing on the balls of your feet, with your foot directly underneath your body with every step. A short, low arm swing is the key to keeping your stride short and close to the ground. 
2. Many people will naturally land mid-sole when running barefoot. Practice running on carpet, grass, or turf with no shoes for short periods of time, so your body can find its natural stride. Start with 30 seconds at first and work your way up to a minute or more. This doesn't mean you should run barefoot all the time since that could lead to injury. But running short intervals on a soft, safe surface allows you to practice mid-foot landing.  
3. Running drills such as butt kicks, skipping, high knees, running backward, or side shuffles are another great way to practice mid-foot landing. When you do any of those drills, it’s impossible to land on your heels. So, the more you practice them, the more you’ll be accustomed to landing on the front part of your foot, as opposed to your heel. You can do running drills as part of your pre-run warm-up or work them into your run. For example, you could intersperse 30-second intervals of high knees or backward running every 4 to 5 minutes during a 30-minute run.  
4. You can practice changing your footstrike during shorter runs at first, and then work your way up to doing it during longer runs. Don't worry if you don't see an improvement overnight. It can take months of practice before you're able to run that way consistently.


Begin your run. Don't start out racing, but instead jog slowly at first and gradually build up your speed. You should be breathing very easily. If you feel yourself getting out of breath, slow down. This is part of knowing how fast you should run, and it's easy to start off too fast.  
Pay attention to your running posture and form when you begin your run. Ensure you are using the best technique before you speed up.
