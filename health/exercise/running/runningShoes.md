 The general rule of thumb is that you should get between 800 to 1000 kilometers or 500 to 650 miles out of a pair of running shoes. So when you hit that 800km or 500 miles mark, you know you should start shopping. However, the mileage you get out of a pair of running shoes also depends on your weight and how you run.

 Generally speaking, a shoe’s lifespan will vary based on the weight of the runner, the type of terrain most often covered, and how frequently they run. 

 Awareness of your running technique and style is essential to avoiding injury. It’s important to take note of your pronation type. Knowing your pronation type will go hand in hand with your running technique. Your pronation style can affect how many kilometres your running shoes last. A heavy overpronator who runs daily will wear their shoes out faster than, say, a lighter, neutral runner running the same frequency.

 I use ASICS GT-2000s and they usually last 350km to 400km, or a year, in my case (a couple 5k to 8k runs per week). I guess different styles of running could also cause different amounts of wear and tear.
