### Hamstring tendinitis
Hamstring tendinitis is inflammation of one of the hamstring tendons at the point where it attaches to the back of the knee.

- Pain is likely to have come on gradually. You may have had a ‘niggle’, or restriction that you have put up with for some time.
- You may feel stiffness at the back of the knee, which is often worse in the mornings, or after sitting for long periods.
- Often, when your tendon warms up pain eases off, only to return later.

Exercises to strengthen the hip muscles, in particular the large gluteus maximus muscle may also be beneficial.  
Avoid doing too many accelerating/decelerating runs or hill work
