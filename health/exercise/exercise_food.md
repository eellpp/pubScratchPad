#### Should we exercise in empty stomach. What food to eat before early morning exercise

For light or low-impact exercises, such as walking, golfing, or gentle yoga, you may not need to fuel up beforehand.

However, you should always eat before exercise that requires a lot of strength, energy, and endurance. This includes tennis, running, and swimming. It’s especially important if you plan to work out for longer than an hour.

If you’re going for a brisk walk, or even if you’re running or getting on a spin bike, and you’re doing something that’s consistent -- where you’re staying within 70 to 80 percent of your max aerobic [rate] for a continuous hour -- then it’s better to do fasting aerobics
