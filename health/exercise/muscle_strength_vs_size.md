### Increase muscle strength  
 To build strength, the goal should be to do fewer reps at a higher weight that challenges you during each repetition.  
 - 2 to 5 heavier sets of 3 to 5 reps   
 However, it is wise to establish a solid overall fitness level before moving on to heavier weights since heavier weights come with more risk if your form is not correct.  
 
 Strength training has a lower training volume (fewer days, longer rest periods) but higher intensity  
 
 Example Warm up sequence for strength focuses bench press:  
- 1 set, 15 reps (95 lbs, 2 minutes rest)
- 1 set, 8 reps (135 lbs, 2 minutes rest)
- 1 set, 3 reps (205 lbs, 2 minutes rest)
- 1 set, 1 rep (225 lbs, 2 minutes rest)


In his "Encyclopedia of Muscle & Strength," Jim Stoppani, PhD, advises taking long rest periods between sets of the main exercise. "Lifting heavy weight for low reps requires energy derived from anaerobic metabolism, called the ATP-PC (adenosine triphosphate-phosphocreatine) system," says Stoppani. "This metabolic pathway provides the immediate energy required for lifting heavy weight or performing explosive movements for a short period. This system requires more than 3 minutes of rest for the majority of recovery to occur."1

On your main lift, rest 3-5 minutes between sets. As you increase the load on your primary lift relative to your max, such as when you go from 80 percent of your 1RM to 90, a longer rest period is called for.

### Increase muscle size  
The key to increasing muscle size is volume, meaning adding more sets and reps to your workout over time.   
Do more reps with challenging weights 
more frequent workouts and shorter rest periods in between sets

- 1 to 3 sets per exercise of 8 to 12 repetitions with a moderate load or 70-85% of your one-rep-max is ideal  


### Size and strength
In simple terms, strength is about increasing force production. Size, on the other hand, is about getting a pump and creating microscopic damage to the muscle, which then causes it to repair and grow larger. This is hypertrophy in a nutshell.

The general rule of thumb when training for strength is that the reps should be low and the resistance load should be high. Also, true low-rep strength work is primarily neuromuscular. If you think of your body as a computer, strength training is more about upgrading your software, which is your central nervous system (CNS), than it is about the hardwareâ€”your muscles. Strength training is about teaching your CNS how to bring more muscle into the game; or to increase motor unit recruitment.

Unlike strength training, the goal of training for size is more physiological than it is neurological. It's about upgrading your body's hardware, like bones, connective tissues, and muscles. You literally build your body, forcing the tissues to develop and grow stronger.

### Increasing muscle size
If you want to improve muscle size, maximize your time under tension on every rep by:

1. Using strict form.
2. Utilizing controlled eccentric (lowering) movements of at least three seconds.
3. Mentally focusing on the muscles being worked and squeezing those muscles at the peak of contraction.
4. Avoiding fully locking out, so the muscles are under tension throughout the movement.
