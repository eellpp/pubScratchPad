### Low Testosterone with ageing
Low levels of testosterone are associated with loss of muscle, weight gain, depression and osteoporosis.

### Increase Testosterone with exercise
Endurance training and resistance training (such as weight lifting) both boost testosterone levels  

Lifting weights or doing other strength-training workouts has a bigger effect on your testosterone. The following strategies will give you an even bigger boost in testosterone from your strength training workouts, which is backed up by research.  

- Use more muscles. (For instance, a full-body workout affects this hormone more than doing one exercise, such as biceps curls.)  
- Lift heavier weights rather than doing many reps of light weights.  
- Have shorter rest periods during your workout.  

Still, you should build an overall exercise plan that also includes cardio and flexibility training, so you're helping your overall health.  

Overdoing it, though, could backfire. Elite athletes (and amateurs who overtrain), can see a drop their testosterone level, which is a sign that they’re doing harm to their bodies. In these cases, they tend to have low testosterone and high cortisol, a stress hormone, Schroeder says. He notes that a rise in cortisol can be linked to a fall in testosterone.  

### Ashwagandha suppliment 
Research has shown that ashwagandha may improve body composition and increase strength

In a study to determine a safe and effective dosage for ashwagandha, healthy men who took 750–1,250 mg of pulverized ashwagandha root per day gained muscle strength after 30 days 

In another study, those who took ashwagandha had significantly greater gains in muscle strength and size. It also more than doubled their reductions in body fat percentage, compared with the placebo group
