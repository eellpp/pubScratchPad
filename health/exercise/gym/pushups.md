Aim for 30 pushups in a row and maintain the range between 30 and 40.  

With pushups you are only working a few muscles, the pectorals of the chest and the triceps.  
Beyond these numbers you are not increasing strength but rather endurance.  

Add 30 pushups to other resistance and strength training exercise for overall body strength.   

Your exercises should be structured so you can challenge yourself - effectively. Go near failure on first sets and bring yourself to failure on the last one. When you go to 20 - 30 push-ups in a set, it's past time you switch things up. Some of the things you can do:  

- Add more resistance (weighted west, resistance band or just a backpack with a dumbbell)
- Incorporate explosiveness
- Slow down
- Switch to a more challenging variation (and , for push-ups, there are many)
- A good intensity to volume ratio is an important factor and you should find the one that works for you.

But you can do all the push-ups you want, if you don't rest and recover, you'll injure yourself before you see results. Or you'll burn yourself out quickly and won't be able to perform.

That's why you shouldn't do push-ups “daily”. Pecs are a large muscle group, they take time to recover. Do them twice to three times a week.

But don't forget to do other parts of your body. Muscle imbalances are a great way to make sure you injure yourself in the long run.

With developed pecs, you need developed upper back, rotator cuff, shoulders and lats. That way you avoid postural problems.

But that's almost the whole upper body, one mihght say. Yes, it is. And it doesn't stop there.

Every muscle in your body has a role. You need a balanced physique so each one can perform that role. Imbalances mean that muscles will either get in each others way, or will have to cover for weaker ones. That's where impingements, postural and other problems come in.

If you develop your chest, but you neglect the back, you'll be hunched forward. Your chest will look smaller because of the posture. See, it's all connected.
