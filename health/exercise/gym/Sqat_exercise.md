### bodyweight squats
You should master the basic bodyweight squat before you move on to barbell back squats. Most fitness experts and strength coaches will agree that being able to perform at least 20(good)-50 (better) consecutive bodyweight squats with good form is a good basic standard to go by. 

### barbell back squat

When most people think of the squat, they’re thinking about the barbell back squat, which is largely considered to be the king of all strength training exercises. There is simply no other exercise, and certainly no machine, that produces the level of…muscular stimulation and growth…than the correctly performed full squat.

If your goal is to build muscle, then you are looking for the most efficient way to accumulate training volume, which is typically easiest to do in the 6-12 rep range.
Good:  15 reps of body weight.

When you first start squatting, we recommend sticking to the 6-12 rep range. Lifting heavy weights for a low number of reps is a skill and attempting to do so without sufficient training experience can result in technique breakdown and injury.
