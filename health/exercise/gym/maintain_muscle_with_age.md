### Benefit Resistance/Strength Training
As people age about one-third suffer from osteoporosis, and lifting (heavy!) weights forces body adaptions that help strengthen bones. One also often hears about seniors slipping/falling and breaking hips, which can cause a downward health spiral: doing squats and deadlifts with respectable weights (1.0x to 1.5x your bodyweight) would probably help with that.  
Some simple tests can reliably predict longevity: number of push-ups that can be done, speed of walking up stairs, and a sitting-rising test.All involved strength more than aerobic ability.  

### Choose exercise as per need
If You are obese then go for aerobic more exercise till your weight is in healthy range. Aerobic exercise can make you loose muscle mass as well.Loosing fat is easier than gaining muscles as you age.   
Once you are in healthly weight range, do more of strength training to build muscle mass. This will increase knee strength, bone strength and general good motion in old age. 

Older people typically don’t regain muscle – they regain fat mass – which is “all the more reason for older adults to try and preserve muscle mass during weight loss.

### More Protein with age
As you age you require more protein for muscle synthesis. Aim for 30gm 3 times a day
