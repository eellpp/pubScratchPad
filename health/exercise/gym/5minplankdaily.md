Aside from your abs, you'll also build strength in your shoulders, chest, upper back, and thighs. Squeeze your glutes in this position to activate them and make this move feel easier.

  
#### The Fore Arm Plank

"The forearm plank puts a greater emphasis on the core than the high plank, but both are equally important to work on," says Stephany Bolivar, CrossFit coach and personal trainer at ICE NYC. She suggests perfecting both the high plank and forearm plank before moving on to other plank variations.

The high plank is your best way to build up the ab strength necessary for a forearm plank. Once your forearm plank (demonstrated here by NYC-based trainer Rachel Mariotti) is solid, you can experiment with different challenges, like lifting one leg, reaching one arm straight out in front, or rocking forward and back on your toes.
