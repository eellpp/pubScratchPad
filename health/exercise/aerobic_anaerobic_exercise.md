### Anaerobic vs aerobic
Anaerobic metabolism is the creation of energy through the combustion of carbohydrates in the absence of oxygen. This occurs when your lungs cannot put enough oxygen into the bloodstream to keep up with the demands of your muscles for energy. It generally is used only for short bursts of activity, such as when you sprint when running or cycling or when you are lifting heavy weights.

When there isn't enough oxygen in the bloodstream, glucose and glycogen cannot be fully broken down to carbon dioxide and water. Instead, lactic acid is produced, which can build up in the muscles and degrade muscle function.

Aerobic metabolism is the way your body creates energy through the combustion of carbohydrates, amino acids, and fats in the presence of oxygen. Combustion means burning, which is why this is called burning sugars, fats, and proteins for energy. Aerobic metabolism is used for the sustained production of energy for exercise and other body functions. Examples of exercises that use aerobic metabolism include walking, running, or cycling with sustained effort.


Anaerobic metabolism is not as efficient as aerobic metabolism. A molecule of glucose can only produce three ATP molecules under anaerobic metabolism, while it produces 39 with aerobic metabolism. ATP is what fuels the muscles.

Anaerobic metabolism can only use glucose and glycogen, while aerobic metabolism can also break down fats and protein. Intense bouts of exercise in the anaerobic zone and in the red-line zone with a heart rate over 85 percent of your maximum heart rate will result in using anaerobic metabolism to fuel the muscles.

- Anaerobic metabolism produces lactic acid, which can build up in the muscles to the point where you "feel the burn." This burning sensation is a normal side effect of anaerobic metabolism.
- When your muscles use anaerobic metabolism, lactic acid is produced in your muscle cells. With moderate-intensity exercise, it is able to diffuse out of the cells, but with vigorous muscle contractions it builds up. As you build up more and more lactic acid, your muscles burn and are fatigued.
- Lactic acid is further processed by the liver into glucose to use for fuel, completing the cycle.
- High-intensity intervals turn a normally aerobic exercise like endurance running into an anaerobic exercise. Anaerobic metabolism is needed once you exceed 90% of maximum heart rate.

If your goal is to lose weight through exercise, aerobic metabolism is your friend as it takes fat out of the fat cells and burns it to produce energy for the muscles. It also burns up the available and stored sugars (carbohydrates) in your cells, so any excess won't be processed into fat.


### Aerobic 
Aerobic exercise is anything less than 85% for max HR, and anaerobic exercise is anything above that.  

Max HR = 220 - age.  

Aerobic exercise is sometimes known as "cardio" -- exercise that requires pumping of oxygenated blood by the heart to deliver oxygen to working muscles. 

Muscles are like engines that run on fuel. The fuel for our our muscles is fat and carbohydrates. Oxygen is a key player because, once inside the muscle, it's used to burn fat and carbohydrate for fuel to keep our engines running. The more efficient our muscles are at consuming oxygen, the more fuel we can burn, the more fit we are, and the longer we can exercise.  

Mitochondria inside the muscle increase in number and activity during aerobic exercise. Mitochondria are the powerhouses of your cells. They do all the heavy-duty work to keep you moving. They use the oxygen to burn the fat and carbohydrate that makes you go. The good news is that they increase in number and activity, by as much as 50%, in just a matter of days to weeks in response to regular aerobic exercise in adults of all ages.  

#### Energy production
This energy comes from glucose through a process called glycolysis.  

#### Anaerobic glycois
Anaerobic glycolysis is the transformation of glucose to lactate when limited amounts of oxygen (O2) are available. Anaerobic glycolysis is only an effective means of energy production during short, intense exercise, providing energy for a period ranging from 10 seconds to 2 minutes.  

### Fat Vs Carbs
The difference between them is that fat is energy desity. Fat contains 9 calories per gram whereas carbohydrate has only 4, and so you get more energy and can go farther on a gram of fat than on a gram of carbohydrate. You want to burn fat because it's such an efficient fuel. The catch is that you need more oxygen to burn fat because it's denser than carbohydrate  

### HIT
High intensity exercise is by definition anaerobic. 

### Recommendation
The ACSM recommends 20-60 minutes of continuous aerobic activity (biking, walking, jogging, dancing, swimming, etc.) three to five times a week, at 60%-90% of maximum heart rate, and two to three days of resistance training. This is a more formal, "workout" recommendation, although you can also accumulate the more intense workout in bouts of 10-15 minutes throughout the day if you like.
