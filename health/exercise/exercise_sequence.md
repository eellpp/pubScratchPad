### HIT first OR Cardio first

MedFitness recommends that high intensity training is completed prior to aerobic exercise for individuals who are trying to maximize fat burning. This ensures that the energy needed for glycolysis is used in weightlifting. Then after 30 minutes of weightlifting, the glycogen and blood glucose have been used up and the body uses primarily fatty acids for its fuel.  
Switching to moderate intensity exercise lets the body consume FFA for metabolic energy and also gives the body time to remove the lactic acid so that aerobic exercise can be performed. Thus lifting weights first for 30 minutes and then doing aerobic exercises is the best way to maximize energy used in high intensity training while selectively burning fat efficiently  

Creatine phosphate is always the first source of energy in any type of exercise that is used up, as it replenishes ATP after the conversion to ADP (see article on Creatine Basics). Additionally, glycolysis extracts energy quickly from glucose that is derived from blood glucose or glucose extracted from glycogen phosphorylation. When the body uses all of the glycogen-derived glucose anaerobically, it must then rely on liver breakdown of proteins and lipolysis for the bodyï¿½s energy. 

If the body does not have creatine phosphate or muscle glycogen to burn quickly because aerobic exercise was performed first, then glycolysis for weightlifting is sub-optimized. If one does aerobic exercise first, then one will use their creatine and glycogen reserves without burning much fat. Then when one turns to anaerobic exercise afterwards he/she will be without his/her reserves of energy needed for glycolysis. When one does aerobics first and then high intensity training the workout is sub-optimized in all aspects.
