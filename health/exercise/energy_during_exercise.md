When you exercise, your muscles (the cells the make your muscle) act something like electric motors. Your muscles take in a source of energy and they use it to generate force. An electric motor uses electricity to supply its energy. Your muscles are biochemical motors, and they use a chemical called adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for their energy source. During the process of "burning" ATP, your muscles need three things:  

- They need oxygen, because chemical reactions require ATP and oxygen is consumed to produce ATP.  
- They need to eliminate metabolic wastes (carbon dioxide, lactic acid) that the chemical reactions generate.  
- They need to get rid of heat. Just like an electric motor, a working muscle generates heat that it needs to get rid of.  

In order to continue exercising, your muscles must continuously make ATP. To make this happen, your body must supply oxygen to the muscles and eliminate the waste products and heat. The more strenuous the exercise, the greater the demands of working muscle. If these needs are not met, then exercise will cease -- that is, you become exhausted and you won't be able to keep going.  

Because ATP is so important, the body has several different systems to create ATP. These systems work together in phases. The interesting thing is that different forms of exercise use different systems, so a sprinter is getting ATP in a completely different way from a marathon runner!  

ATP comes from three different biochemical systems in the muscle, in this order:

#### phosphagen system , with Creatine ( 8 - 10 sec , 100 metres)
All muscle cells have a little ATP within them that they can use immediately – but only enough to last for about 3 seconds! So all muscle cells contain a high-energy compound called creatine phosphate which is broken down to make more ATP quickly. Creatine phosphate can supply the energy needs of a working muscle at a very high rate, but only for about 8–10 seconds.  

#### glycogen-lactic acid system ( 1.3 - 1.6 m , 400 metres swimming)
Fortunately, muscles also have large stores of a carbohydrate, called glycogen, which can be used to make ATP from glucose. But this takes about 12 chemical reactions so it supplies energy more slowly than from creatine phosphate. It’s still pretty rapid, though, and will produce enough energy to last about 90 seconds. Oxygen is not needed – this is great, because it takes the heart and lungs some time to get increased oxygen supply to the muscles. A byproduct of making ATP without using oxygen is lactic acid. You know when your muscles are building up lactic acid because it causes tiredness and soreness – the stitch.  

#### aerobic respiration (marathon runner, 15 km )
Within two minutes of exercise, the body starts to supply working muscles with oxygen. When oxygen is present, aerobic respiration can take place to break down the glucose for ATP.
