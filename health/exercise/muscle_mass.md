### Muscle mass loss with ageing and its side effects
Age-related muscle loss, called sarcopenia, is a natural part of aging. After age 30, you begin to lose as much as 3% to 5% per decade. Most men will lose about 30% of their muscle mass during their lifetimes.  

Less muscle means greater weakness and less mobility, both of which may increase your risk of falls and fractures. A 2015 report from the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research found that people with sarcopenia had 2.3 times the risk of having a low-trauma fracture from a fall, such as a broken hip, collarbone, leg, arm, or wrist.  

The best means to build muscle mass, no matter your age, is progressive resistance training (PRT), says Dr. Storer. With PRT, you gradually amp up your workout volume—weight, reps, and sets—as your strength and endurance improve.  A typical training program might include  
- 8 to 10 exercises that target all the major muscle groups  
- sets of 12 to 15 reps, performed at an effort of about 5 to 7 on a 10-point scale  
- two or three workouts per week.  

This constant challenging builds muscle and keeps you away from plateaus where you stop making gains. In fact, a recent meta-analysis published in Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise reviewed 49 studies of men ages 50 to 83 who did PRT and found that subjects averaged a 2.4-pound increase in lean body mass.  


### Power—not just strength
Building muscle is not all about strength, says Dr. Storer. You also need power. "Muscle power, how fast and efficiently you move, is more connected to the activities of daily living and physical function than muscular strength," he says.

A good way to improve overall muscle power is with your legs, since they are most responsible for mobility. "Doing quicker movements against resistance, like one's own body weight, can be an effective means of developing power," says Dr. Storer.

For instance, when rising from a seated position, try to do it quickly. When climbing stairs, hold the handrail and push off a step as fast as possible. "It does not have to be every step—begin with one to three steps—but this teaches your muscles to use strength in a more effective way."
