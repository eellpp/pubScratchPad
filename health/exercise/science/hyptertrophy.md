### Hypertrophy
Muscle size increases when a person continually challenges the muscles to deal with higher levels of resistance or weight. This process is known as muscle hypertrophy.

Muscle hypertrophy occurs when the fibers of the muscles sustain damage or injury. The body repairs damaged fibers by fusing them, which increases the mass and size of the muscles.

Increasing muscle size, also called hypertrophy, will occur whether you train at the lower rep range with higher weight or a higher rep range of 8 to 12 with a moderately challenging weight.

 The key to increasing muscle size is volume, meaning adding more sets and reps to your workout over time. You can spread these additional sets and reps over your weekly training sessions.

For beginners, 1 to 3 sets per exercise of 8 to 12 repetitions with a moderate load or 70-85% of your one-rep-max is ideal. More advanced individuals looking to further develop their muscle mass aim for anywhere from 3 to 6 sets per exercise of 1 to 12 repetitions with a loading range of 70-100% of your one-rep-max. Aim for 12 to 28 sets per muscle group per week spread over 3 to 5 training days for optimal muscle growth.

### Rest
Rest plays an integral part in building muscle. By not letting each of the muscle groups rest, a person will reduce their ability to repair. Insufficient rest also slows fitness progression and increases the risk of injury. people should not carry out strength training on the same muscle group on 2 consecutive days.
