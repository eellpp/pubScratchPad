2. Mesomorph
3. Ectomorph

### ENDOMORPHIC
Stockier bone structures with larger midsection and hips.  
Carries more fat throughout the body.  
Gains fat fast and loses it slow.  
Naturally slow metabolism; potentially due to chronic conditions (e.g., thyroid deficiency, diabetes) but too frequently the result of a sedentary lifestyle and chronically-positive daily energy balance.  

Training endomorphs should predominantly focus on fat loss techniques until a desirable body composition and functional cardiorespiratory efficiency have been achieved. Resistance training should be used to strengthen muscles and stabilize joints to support more-efficient movement elsewhere in life, but this population tends to need cardiorespiratory improvement and fat loss above all.  

1. Maximize calorie burn and the improvement of metabolic efficiency by primarily using high-intensity, metabolic training techniques.
2. Consume a high-protein diet with balanced carbs and fats that maintains a slight negative energy balance.

### Exercises for endomorphic
In the gym, work through OPT Phase 1 and Phase 2, but keep the majority of training sessions focused on metabolic conditioning. Use short rest periods, circuits for resistance exercises, lots of plyometrics

### Plyometric  
https://blog.nasm.org/fitness/developing-power-in-everyday-athletes-with-plyometrics  
plyometric exercises are based on three components, 
- an eccentric component that stretches the muscle,  
- the amortization component focusing on dynamic stabilization, 
- and the concentric component that concentrically contracts the muscle.

Top 5 Plyometric Exercises  
1. Box jumps
2. Reverse lunge knee-ups
3. Burpees
4. Clapping push-ups
5. Tuck jumps
