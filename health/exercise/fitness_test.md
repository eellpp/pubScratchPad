### Bruce Protocol 
The Bruce protocol treadmill test is used for estimating the overall fitness of endurance athletes. The test was originally designed by cardiologist Robert A. Bruce in 1963 as a non-invasive test to assess patients with suspected heart disease.1﻿ In a clinical setting, the Bruce treadmill test protocol is sometimes called a stress test or exercise tolerance test. The test can be used to estimate maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max), which is a measure of an athlete's capacity to performed sustained exercise. It is linked to aerobic endurance.

### Sitting Rising Test
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitting-rising_test  

 "Without worrying about the speed of movement, try to sit and then to rise from the floor, using the minimum support that you believe is needed." The maximum possible score on the SRT is 10 points: a possible total of 5 points for sitting down, and 5 points for rising from the floor to a standing position. Use of a hand, forearm, knee, or the side of the leg to press up from the ground—or bracing a hand on the knee—each result in a deduction of one point. The minimum possible score is 0 points. An additional 0.5 points is deducted if the evaluator perceives an unsteady execution or partial loss of balance. If the subject loses points on the first few attempts, the evaluator provides advice to help them improve their score on subsequent tries. The best scores for sitting and rising are used to determine the final score  

8 - 10 : Good score  
3.5 - 7.5 : Fair  
0 - 3 : Poor  

those with scores in the lowest range (0 to 3) were 5–6 times more likely to die within the study period (about 6 years) than those in the group with the highest scores (8 to 10)
