Potassium is probably the most important electrolyte we measure routinely. It is essential for every cell in the body, and its movement in and out of cells is key to many of the body’s functions.   

Cells in the heart depend on the flow of potassium to work properly. Either too much or too little of it could cause the heart to develop a life-threatening arrhythmia.  


**Potassium deficiency**. 
You might experience lip twitching if you have low levels of potassium in your system. This mineral is an electrolyte and helps carry nerve signals in the body.

Potassium deficiencies can negatively affect the muscles and cause spasms and cramps. Treatment for potassium deficiency includes adding potassium-rich foods to the diet and avoiding medications that could be affecting your potassium levels.

**High Pottasium**. 
Many people with high potassium have few, if any, symptoms. If symptoms do appear, they are usually mild and non-specific. You may feel some muscle weakness, numbness, tingling, nausea, or other unusual feelings. High potassium usually develops slowly over many weeks or months, and is most often mild. It can recur. For most people, the level of potassium in your blood should be between 3.5 and 5.0, depending on the laboratory that is used.

If high potassium happens suddenly and you have very high levels, you may feel heart palpitations, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, or vomiting. This is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical care. If you have these symptoms, call 911 or go to the emergency room.

Try avoiding certain salt substitutes. Certain salt substitutes are high in potassium. Most people with kidney disease should not use them.

Kidney removes excess pottasium. If kidney is not working properly then excess pottasium in blood builds up.  

### Pottasium and BP
Increasing potassium intake can help decrease your blood pressure if you have high blood pressure. By lowering blood pressure, increasing potassium intake can also reduce your risk for heart disease and stroke. In contrast, consuming too much sodium can raise your blood pressure.

Food: 
- banana
- beans
- greens
- beets
- Yogurt
- coconut water

Foods such as melons, orange juice, and bananas are high in potassium.

Roughly 98% of the potassium in your body is found in your cells. Of this, 80% is found in your muscle cells, while the other 20% can be found in your bones, liver and red blood cells   

### Pottasium helps balance fluid levels inside and outside cells
The body is made of approximately 60% water  
40% of this water is found inside your cells in a substance called intracellular fluid (ICF).  
The remainder is found outside your cells in areas such as your blood, spinal fluid and between cells. This fluid is called extracellular fluid (ECF).  
Interestingly, the amount of water in the ICF and ECF is affected by their concentration of electrolytes, especially potassium and sodium.  
Potassium is the main electrolyte in the ICF, and it determines the amount of water inside the cells. Conversely, sodium is the main electrolyte in the ECF, and it determines the amount of water outside the cells.  
The number of electrolytes relative to the amount of fluid is called osmolality. Under normal conditions, the osmolality is the same inside and outside your cells.  
Simply put, there’s an equal balance of electrolytes outside and inside your cells.  
However, when osmolality is unequal, water from the side with fewer electrolytes will move into the side with more electrolytes to equalize electrolyte concentrations.  
This may cause cells to shrink as water moves out of them, or swell up and burst as water moves into them.  
That’s why it’s important to make sure you consume the right electrolytes, including potassium.  
Maintaining good fluid balance is important for optimal health. Poor fluid balance can lead to dehydration, which in turn affects the heart and kidneys  
Eating a potassium-rich diet and staying hydrated can help maintain good fluid balance
