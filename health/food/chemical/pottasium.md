Potassium is probably the most important electrolyte we measure routinely. It is essential for every cell in the body, and its movement in and out of cells is key to many of the body’s functions.   

Cells in the heart depend on the flow of potassium to work properly. Either too much or too little of it could cause the heart to develop a life-threatening arrhythmia.

Roughly 98% of the potassium in your body is found in your cells. Of this, 80% is found in your muscle cells, while the other 20% can be found in your bones, liver and red blood cells   

### Pottasium helps balance fluid levels inside and outside cells
The body is made of approximately 60% water  
40% of this water is found inside your cells in a substance called intracellular fluid (ICF).  
The remainder is found outside your cells in areas such as your blood, spinal fluid and between cells. This fluid is called extracellular fluid (ECF).  
Interestingly, the amount of water in the ICF and ECF is affected by their concentration of electrolytes, especially potassium and sodium.  
Potassium is the main electrolyte in the ICF, and it determines the amount of water inside the cells. Conversely, sodium is the main electrolyte in the ECF, and it determines the amount of water outside the cells.  
The number of electrolytes relative to the amount of fluid is called osmolality. Under normal conditions, the osmolality is the same inside and outside your cells.  
Simply put, there’s an equal balance of electrolytes outside and inside your cells.  
However, when osmolality is unequal, water from the side with fewer electrolytes will move into the side with more electrolytes to equalize electrolyte concentrations.  
This may cause cells to shrink as water moves out of them, or swell up and burst as water moves into them.  
That’s why it’s important to make sure you consume the right electrolytes, including potassium.  
Maintaining good fluid balance is important for optimal health. Poor fluid balance can lead to dehydration, which in turn affects the heart and kidneys  
Eating a potassium-rich diet and staying hydrated can help maintain good fluid balance
