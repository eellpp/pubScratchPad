Tea has an amino acid theanine that is shown to reduce stress. And when you combine theanine with caffeine, it helps to boost your brain activity as well as your mood. Tea is also full of antioxidants  

### Theanine in tea
Theanine is an amino acid found in tea. It is also found in some mushrooms. Some people take theanine by mouth for anxiety and stress, depression, schizophrenia, for preventing Alzheimer's disease, for treating attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and improving mental performance and attention.  

Theanine has calming effect on body. Theanine + caffenine improves brain performance and mood.  

### Caffeine in tea
Tea leaves actually contain more caffeine than coffee beans. Before brewing, tea leaves contain more caffeine than coffee beans.  
Tea leaves contain 3.5% caffeine, while coffee beans have 1.1–2.2%. However, the coffee brewing process uses hotter water, which extracts more of the caffeine from the beans. Typically, you also use more coffee beans than you’d use tea leaves for a drink (12).Therefore, 1 cup (237 ml) of brewed coffee generally has more caffeine than a cup of tea.  

An average cup (237 ml) of black tea packs 47 mg of caffeine but can contain as much as 90 mg. For comparison, green teas contain 20–45 mg, while white teas deliver 6–60 mg per cup (237 ml)  

- caffeine has been linked to health benefits like enhanced alertness, improved athletic performance, elevated mood, and increased metabolism
- caffeine is considered mildly addictive
- In large doses, caffeine has been associated with anxiety, restlessness, and difficulty sleeping. In addition, some studies suggest that drinking it regularly, even in moderate amounts, can cause chronic headaches and migraines

For daily caffiene intake the max is 4 cup of brewed coffee

### Catechins in green tea and benefits
Green tea contains more catechins than the other teas, mainly because of the way it is processed after harvesting.  Once in the body, the catechins undergo metabolic processing in the liver and small intestine and colon.  
Various studies in humans have found that the peak concentrations of catechins and their metabolites occur in blood plasma between 1.5 and 2 hours after ingestion and in urine between 4 and 6 hours after ingestion.  

The antimicrobial effects of green tea catechins (GTCs) on microorganisms have been studied for many years. Green tea has been shown to combat these organisms in various ways, directly and indirectly, and has been shown to work synergistically with some antibiotic agents.  

One of the major properties of GTCs is the ability to bind to bacterial cell membranes.  An important result of green tea binding is the loss of bacterial ability to bind to host cells.  
Green tea catechins have also been shown to be effective against a number of viruses, parasites, fungi, and even prions. 

There are also many areas across the globe where the cost of drugs is currently beyond the earning power of most of the population. Green tea is relatively inexpensive and fairly easy to obtain for most people. It could prove to be an answer for improving health on a global scale.  

### catechins in blacks tea  
Catechins are the major components of green tea leaves. In black tea, they are oxidized and dimerized during fermentation to the yellow-orange “pigments,” TF, or polymerized to the red “pigments” called thearubigins.


### Green And Black Tea Come From The Same Plant 
To make green tea, young opened leaves and buds are cut from the plants. The leaves are left to wither ― which allows the water to evaporate ― and they are then steamed or pan-fired. This prevents the enzymes that are naturally found in the leaves from oxidizing. The leaves are then dried while maintaining their green color.  

To make black tea, freshly plucked leaves are withered, similar to green tea. They are then rolled to release the enzymes from the leaves. After rolling, the leaves are laid out to oxidize. This is what gives the leaves their characteristic black color. Only once sufficiently oxidized are the leaves dried (which stops further oxidation). The oxidation is what gives black tea its deep flavor.

#### Should we drink green tea early morning empty stomach ?
Drinking green tea on an empty stomach in the morning can cause bad effects on the liver because of its high content of catechins.

Green tea has compounds called catechins, so the amount of green tea consumed must be controlled. The higher concentration of catechins can cause liver damage. Drink green tea in the morning around 10:00 to 11:00 pm or early at night  

You can drink a cup of green tea between meals, for example, two hours before or after to maximize the nutrient intake and iron absorption  
### Drink green tea before exercise
Green tea contains caffeine and L-theanine, both of which can enhance alertness and attention, which is especially beneficial in the morning. Also, drinking this tea before exercise may increase fat burning and reduce muscle damage.  

This is because green tea has been shown to increase fat burning and boost the metabolic rate, in human controlled trial  


### Do not drink tea during meal time
Several compounds in green tea can bind to minerals in your body and block their absorption.  

### Polyphenols in green tea are anti oxidants
Green tea is about 30 percent polyphenols by weight, including large amounts of a catechin called EGCG. Catechins are natural antioxidants that help prevent cell damage and provide other benefits.

These substances can reduce the formation of free radicals in the body, protecting cells and molecules from damage. These free radicals are known to play a role in aging and all sorts of diseases.

EGCG (Epigallocatechin Gallate) is one of the most powerful compounds in green tea. It has been studied to treat various diseases and may be one of the main reasons green tea has such powerful medicinal properties
