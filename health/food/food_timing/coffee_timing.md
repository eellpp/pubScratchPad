- coffee increase alertness (increase cortisol)
- decreases sleep (inhibits adenosine receptors)

use it judicially during the day for your advantage without jeopardizing the bodies sleep cycle


### Wake up time
- Drinking coffee immediatly after waking up is not efficient. Cortisol levels are already at peak early morning when we wake up. (health/hormone/cortisol.md) . Coffee further elevates the cortisol production during just wake up time. Instead use coffee later during day when cortisol is lower and adenosine has built up. Mostly during late morning and effect would then peak in 6 hours (late afternoon)  

- taking in caffeine blocks the clearing of adenosine (the feel tired hormone). So if you drink caffeine in the first ~90minutes of waking then you dont actually clear the adenosine as well, and then when the caffeine hits it's half life (about 6 hours later) you'll feel tired again. Solution: let your body clear adenosine naturally before you consume caffeine.  

### Adenosine

Adenosine is one of the body’s more powerful molecules and is linked to the digestion process. 

Adenosine is a component of the “energy molecule” ATP as well as the intracellular signaling molecule, cyclic AMP, and it accumulates in the brain the longer you are awake, which makes you feel tired. 

During digestion, the glucose in the foods we eat breaks down into glycolysis. This breaks down further into Adenosine Tri-Phosphate (ATP). This is responsible for energy transference between cells. After ATP is “used up”, it decomposes yet again into adenosine. As adenosine builds up in the bloodstream, it interacts with specific cell receptors, inhibiting neural activity and causing drowsiness.

What does this actually mean? Well, when the body runs out of fuel in the form of easily digestible sugars from the food we eat, adenosine signals the body to become drowsy. This essentially tells us to sleep and rebuild our energy reserves. It’s a critical chain reaction that initiates the early stages of non-REM sleep and is essential to the natural sleep cycle.

- An increase in adenosine increases a person's need for sleep, also called the sleep drive or sleep pressure. It builds up during the day
-  Our bodies flush the built-up adenosine over the course of our night’s sleep. When you sleep, your brain metabolizes all the excess adenosine accumulated during the day. This is one of the major restorative functions of sleep. Taking a good night sleep is key to remove adenosine levels
-  But the chemical residue doesn’t just disappear the moment we wake up--it takes a while (about 60-90 minutes for most of us) for the effects to burn off completely. This is grogginess

To minimize grogginess
- Step into sunlight for 15 - 20 min
- do some exercise
- Use the grogginess time to do chores or stuff that does not require much

### adenosine and coffee

When you drink coffee or tea in an effort to stay awake, you block those adenosine receptors and the sensation of tiredness. Thus the sensation of tiredness is not there but still the adenosine levels are not decreased. This will cause a later build of sleep pressure when effect if coffee slows down (8 + hours) 

The urge to grab that cup of Coffee each morning is typical since many people experience post-sleep grogginess. This grogginess may be attributed to an excessive build of up of adenosine levels during waking hours that does not fully dissipate during the standard sleep cycle.   

By drinking beverages with high levels of caffeine, the body builds up an excessive amount of adenosine. Often this excess is not fully flushed from the body during sleep. This surplus of adenosine, therefore, contributes to the grogginess many suffer each morning. This feeling encourages people to load up on more caffeine. And on and on it goes! It’s a vicious cycle that results in poorer sleep and feeling tired all day.


### Best time for coffee
 Experts recommend avoiding caffeine before bed or late in the day, as it blocks the normal process of adenosine. Having a late-in-the-day caffeine boost can force the body to remain awake when it should be winding down. To avoid this, doctors recommend halting caffeine consumption after 2pm, and that no more than 2-3 units (equivalent to a 2-3 cups of coffee) be ingested on any given day.
