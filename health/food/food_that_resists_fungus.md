By not allowing Candida to survive, avocados, chia seeds, wild-caught fish and other healthy foods all help with candidiasis, but there are other foods that literally attack and kill the bacteria. Garlic is a natural anti-fungal that will kill Candida, as is turmeric (also known as curcumin). But the best, most potent, all-natural Candida killer is probably coconut oil. It contains caprylic acid, which has anti-microbial properties that are proven to kill yeasts and Candida. And studies have shown that it is even more effective in treating candidiasis than the prescription drug fluconazole.  

Yeast, a fungus, relies on sugar – a form of energy – for its vitality. Therefore, the more sugar there is in your body, the more the yeast will thrive, potentially leading to an overgrowth.  

 Much like how a high-sugar diet encourages Candida overgrowth, the same is true for a diet that's too high in alcohol consumption.  

### Digestive issues
When the bacteria in your gut become imbalanced, you can experience digestive issues, including constipation, diarrhea, nausea, gas, cramps and bloating.

 If a Candida infection enters your bloodstream and travels through your body, it can infect the joints and cause arthritis. This typically only happens after surgery or when an overgrowth of Candida is left untreated for an extended period of time.  
 
 #### Skin fungal infections
 That’s why a change in the environment on your skin can allow Candida to overproduce. For example, cosmetics, soaps and moisturizers can alter skin conditions, especially the antibacterial varieties. While skin candidiasis can affect any part of the body, areas that are warm and moist, such as the armpits and groin, are particularly prone to infection. Itching and a visible rash are the two most common symptoms of skin fungal infections.
