Consuming foods – especially those high in starch and sugar – right before bed causes a spike in blood sugar. Your pancreas then releases a hormone called insulin, which tells your cells to absorb blood sugar. This causes blood sugar levels to drop, leading to hunger

Your appetite centers are located in the nuclei within your brain stem and hypothalamus. The cells in these areas respond to your blood glucose level, to nerve impulses arising from your gastrointestinal tract, to various hormones, including ghrelin, leptin and thyroid hormones, and to numerous other stimuli. Fluctuations in hormone and blood glucose levels impact your appetite in a predictable fashion. For example, a falling blood glucose level or an increasing ghrelin level stimulates hunger, while rising glucose or leptin levels suppress your appetite. Insulin influences the levels of many other appetite-regulating factors.


Insulin and Appetite
Insulin is a hormone produced by your pancreas in response to consuming a meal. Insulin stimulates the cells in your liver, fat tissue and muscles to absorb glucose and then to burn it for energy or store it for future use. As insulin drives your glucose level downward, your pancreas and adrenal glands produce counter-regulatory hormones, such as glucagon and epinephrine. The appetite centers in your brain are stimulated by falling glucose levels and counter-regulatory hormones, making you feel hungry again. Thus, the more insulin your pancreas produces in response to a given meal, the greater the subsequent rebound in your appetite.


Eating at Night
When you eat a meal at bedtime, particularly one rich in sugars and other simple carbohydrates, you generate an insulin surge from your pancreas. Upon retiring, this insulin begins pushing glucose into your cells, a process that continues as you sleep. During the night, a continual drop in your blood glucose stimulates the release of counter-regulatory hormones, leading to stimulation of your appetite centers. Unless you get up in the middle of the night to satisfy your appetite, you will be hungry upon arising in the morning.

Maintaining Normal Blood Sugar Levels
The bloodstream carries glucose-a type of sugar produced from the digestion of carbohydrates and other foods-to provide energy to cells throughout the body. Unused glucose is stored mainly in the liver as glycogen.

Insulin , glucagon, and other hormone levels rise and fall to keep blood sugar in a normal range. Too little or too much of these hormones can cause blood sugar levels to fall too low (hypoglycemia) or rise too high (hyperglycemia).

Normally, blood glucose levels increase after you eat a meal. When blood sugar rises, cells in the pancreas release insulin, causing the body to absorb glucose from the blood and lowering the blood sugar level to normal. When blood sugar drops too low, the level of insulin declines and other cells in the pancreas release glucagon, which causes the liver to turn stored glycogen back into glucose and release it into the blood. This brings blood sugar levels back up to normal.
