Brain scans show that there is physical deterioration of brain for people suffering from memory losses, depressions, mood disorders or injuries. It is possible to heal the brain.  

>> Did you know that Alzheimer's disease actually starts in the brain 30 to 50 years before you have any symptoms?  
>> The real reason not to use drugs - they damage your brain.  
>> Obsessiveâ€“compulsive disorder where the front part of the brain typically works too hard, so that people cannot turn off their thoughts.  
>> An epilepsy where we frequently see areas of increased activity.  
>> Researchers have found that undiagnosed brain injuries are a major cause of homelessness, drug and alcohol abuse, depression, panic attacks, ADHD, and suicide.  
>> So after 22 years and 83,000 scans, the single most important lesson my colleagues and I have learned is that you can literally change people's brains. And when you do, you change their life.  
>> where we put players on a brain-smart program and demonstrated that 80% of them could improve in the areas of blood flow, memory, and mood, that you are not stuck with the brain you have, you can make it better on a brain-smart program.  

### Food and habits to heal and reverse brain damage

If you are eating saturated fats, then the risk of brain damage is 3x more. Saturated fats are typically solid at room temperature. These are found in fatty beef, lamb, pork, poultry with skin, beef fat (tallow), lard and cream, butter, cheese and other dairy products.  
mild cognitive impairment is found in people who eat more of saturated fats  
>> Vitamin E is the fire extinguisher for brain. Vitamin E is in spinach, and it's in mangoes, and it's especially in nuts and seeds. And the beauty of this is vitamin E is an antioxidant it knocks out free radicals (from excess iron, copper etc ).  Research showed that people getting eight milligrams a day of vitamin E cut their risk of Alzheimer's by about half compared to people getting less than that.  

>> Nature has eight forms of vitamin E. Eating the pill gives you only one of the form. If I put some nuts or seeds into the palm of my hand, by the time it hits your fingers, that's just one ounce, and that's about five milligrams of vitamin E, right there.  
>> A grape has to sit on the vine, all day long under the sun, and exposed to the elements, and it has no protection.Or does it? That purple color, those anthocyanins happen to be powerful antioxidants, just like vitamin E, but they're the grape form, and if you consume them, they go into your bloodstream. And if that's true, it doesn't have to be grapes, it could be anything that has that color. Like blueberries.  

>> You walk into the grocery store, and from a hundred feet away, looking at the produce department, you can recognize beta-carotene, lycopene, anthocyanins. Your retina can detect them because that's the orange color of a carrot, or the red color of a tomato, or the purple color of a grape. And the brain also tells you they're pretty, they're attractive, you can recognize antioxidants, you're drawn to them.  
So, we devised a plate that said fruits, and grains, and legumes and vegetables, those should be the staples.  

`Excercise` :  
>> The exercisers found that their hippocampus was a little bit bigger, and a little bit bigger, and a little bit bigger, it was as if time was going backwards: It reversed brain shrinkage, and on memory tests, they did substantially better.  
40 minutes brisk walk, three times a week is all you need to improve memory and reverse brain shrinkage.
