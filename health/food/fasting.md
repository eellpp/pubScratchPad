A typical well-nourished 70-kg man has fuel reserves totaling about 161,000 kcal (670,000 kJ; see Table 30.1). The energy need for a 24-hour period ranges from about 1600 kcal (6700 kJ) to 6000 kcal (25,000 kJ), depending on the extent of activity. Thus, stored fuels suffice to meet caloric needs in starvation for 1 to 3 months. However, the carbohydrate reserves are exhausted in only a day.

### Eating Schedule:

9 am - 10 am : Light protein and vegetables to break the fast.  
egg + veggies + nuts  

12:30 - 1:30 am : full meal for the day + fruits

- Take 2 - 3 weeks off from fasting every 6 months.  



### David Sinclair in lifspan :  
If there is only one thing that i can suggest to people to improve their overall health and wellbeing, then its "EAT LESS"  

Not eating to full: daily  
Intermittent fasting: weekly  
Full day fasting : monthly  


### Intermittant fasting for 40 year old
Do 20 hour fasting every other day . 3 to 4 times a week  
Break the fast with smaller protien diet. Then after few hours eat the fuller meal.  

During the fasting time you can exercise. Its good for the body. Drink enough water.

### Buddha ate one meal a day
Buddha mostly likely ate only once a day after his enlightenment, or at least thatâ€™s what Buddhists believe.

In line, most Buddhist monks also eat only once a day, sometimes twice (including a breakfast but never dinner unless sick). Lay Buddhists also sometimes eat only once a day when they are keeping the eight precepts that include not eating at the wrong times. 

The Buddha did not eat once a day as an act of austerity as one may think, but rather for health benefits and its practical advantages. Buddhist masters who engage in this practice emphasize the health benefits by pointing out that a single meal means the body only needs to digest food once a day and, therefore, expends far less energy than a typical three meal a day diet. Moreover, less time is spent preparing, consuming, and cleaning up afterward. When the body is given less food, necessity assures full use of the nutrients it receives. 

The main aim is to lessen daily chores so that sangha can devote more time to practise contemplative meditation. Secondary benefits are less lust, torpor and anger.
