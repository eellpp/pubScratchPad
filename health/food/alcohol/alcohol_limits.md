Individuals who choose to drink should keep to the recommended limits of one standard drink for women and two standard drinks for men. One standard drink contains 10g of pure alcohol and is equivalent to 1 can of beer (330ml), 1 glass of wine (100ml), or 1 nip (30ml) of spirits. Those who consume more than the recommended amounts should gradually cut down on their intake.  


### Calories
A 12-ounce can of classic formula Coca-Cola has 140 calories. 

Now let’s take a look at beer. The same 12-ounce serving of Budweiser has 144 calories. For Heineken, it’s 149 calories. Stella Artois has 154 calories.

The average recommended daily caloric intake is 2,200 calories for males, and 1,800 calories for females. 

A standard 43-ml shot of whiskey packs 97 calories.  



### Sugar
Beer’s sugar content is comprised of 80% fermentable sugars and 20% oligosaccharides. Yeast can’t digest oligosaccharides, but neither can your body. Thus, beer’s final sugar content may still be quite low.

Coca cola has 39 grams of added sugars in a 350 ml can. 

The American Heart Association recommends that men should have no more than 37.5 grams of sugar per day. Their recommendation for women is just 25 grams a day.

whiskey contains approximately 1 gram of sugar per 100 milliliters. 

### Liver 
Whiskey has high alcohol content, so high consumption may lead to hypoglycemia or liver problems.   


If you are monitoring your sugar intake, you can consume whiskey but make sure to drink it neat or with ice.
