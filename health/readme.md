### Low Stress, low activity and Retirement are likely to cause diseases 
Under stress the body increases cortisol production to keep the energy level up and remain alert. When the stress subsides, the cortisol production is reduced to normal and the suppressed ills break out.

Heart attacks in the first year after retirement are a thing too:  
"Among 5,422 individuals in the study, those who had retired were 40% more likely to have had a heart attack or stroke than those who were still working. The increase was more pronounced during the first year after retirement, and leveled off after that."

- after intense work, in the first few days of vacation people catch flu
- migranes during weekend or before start of week  

A sense of mission to do and achieve something keeps the stress level good enough to stay healthy.  
Someone with a reason to live will actually live longer than someone without one.
