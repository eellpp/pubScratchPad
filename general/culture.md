### Why Socialist systems produce brilliant acadamics compared to capitalistic
Russia had brilliant mathematicians even before the October revolution, however, the Soviet Union gave another incentive to become an academic - it pretty much guaranteed a highly respected job, even if the salary was modest, but also allowed most of the academics to not get involved in politics. So in a country where you couldn't form a business, being an academic or a doctor was pretty much the best career choice

In capitalistic system, the best minds are also trying to make more money. A skill where they might not be best suitable.
