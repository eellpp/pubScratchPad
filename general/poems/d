In battle, in the forest, at the precipice in the mountains,   
On the dark great sea, in the midst of javelins and arrows,  
In sleep, in confusion, in the depths of shame,  
The good deeds a man has done before defend him.

The maid my true heart loves would not my true love be;  
She seeks another man; another maid loves he;  
And me another maid her own true love would see:  
Oh, fie on her and him and Love and HER and me!
