### Still i rise
 https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46446/still-i-rise   

Just like moons and like suns,  
With the certainty of tides,  
Just like hopes springing high,  
Still I'll rise.  


You may shoot me with your words,  
You may cut me with your eyes,  
You may kill me with your hatefulness,  
But still, like air, Iâ€™ll rise.
