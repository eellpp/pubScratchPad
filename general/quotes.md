Did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage? - Pink Floyd  
>>> What he’s asking here is are you doing the things that you want to do? Are you doing the things that you believe in, the things that you feel will be successful? Are you fighting the good fight? Or are you just doing what’s expected of you in exchange for money, an important title, etc. Is someone else controlling your future and your contribution to this world?

The poorest people in the world aren't the ones without money... It's the ones without hope. Always have hope for a better tomorrow!  

Perfect is the enemy of the good  

you’re not going to change until the pain of change is less than the pain of staying the same.  

We are mere Spatiotemporal blips of information in the infant universe with delusions of grandeur. We leave our heritage in everything we touch. Child or stone, no difference. Our ancestors are everywhere

“For what it’s worth... it’s never too late, or in my case too early, to be whoever you want to be. There’s no time limit. Start whenever you want. You can change or stay the same. There are no rules to this thing. We can make the best or the worst of it. I hope you make the best of it. I hope you see things that startle you. I hope you feel things you’ve never felt before. I hope you meet people who have a different point of view. I hope you live a life you’re proud of, and if you’re not, I hope you have the courage to start over again.”

― F. Scott Fitzgerald
