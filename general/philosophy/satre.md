### existence precedes essence 
To existentialists, human beings—through their consciousness—create their own values and determine a meaning for their life because the human being does not possess any inherent identity or value. That identity or value must be created by the individual. By posing the acts that constitute them, they make their existence more significant.   

### Existentialism Is a Humanism
https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/sartre/works/exist/sartre.htm

 Man is all the time outside of himself: 
 - it is in projecting and losing himself beyond himself that he makes man to exist; and,
 -  on the other hand, it is by pursuing transcendent aims that he himself is able to exist. 
 Since man is thus self-surpassing, and can grasp objects only in relation to his self-surpassing, he is himself the heart and center of his transcendence.   
 There is no other universe except the human universe, **the universe of human subjectivity.**    
 ...   
 
 This is humanism, because we remind man that 
 - there is no legislator but himself; that he himself, thus abandoned, must decide for himself; 
 - also because we show that it is not by turning back upon himself, but always by seeking, beyond himself, an aim which is one of liberation or of some particular realisation, that man can realize himself as truly human.


So what does Sartre mean by ‘humanism’? Humanism is a term that alludes to a shift in our intellectual and moral focus – from God to human beings. Sartre deplores a certain type of humanism, one that sees all human beings as ‘magnificent’, as people who must be loved no matter what they may have done, simply because they are human. Sartre’s humanism recognises that there is nothing other than ‘the universe of human subjectivity’, that we all have the potential to invent ourselves and change our lives, and that although moral values are created by individuals we still have a responsibility to every other human being.  

### Purpose of life
Sartre believe that human existence is the result of chance or accident. There is no meaning or purpose of his life other than what his freedom creates , therefore, he must rely on his own resources.

To exist is to happen without reason.... Every thing is purposeless. This garden, this town and myself." - Roquentin in Nausea  

One first has to be overpowered by the 'Nausea of existence', has to acknowledge that the pattern of our lives is due to totally arbitrary ways of living and that any others would do as well.  

### Nausea - Novel  

Thus, Nausea, Sartre's famous novel, Portrays most force fully this condition of man's plight . 

The hero has been moving through life on the basis of an unquestioned acceptance of a certain outlook. But his dis-satisfaction with events forces him to ask whether this is the proper outlook. The quest for some justification for his way of life brings about its disintegration into pure Nausea, as the arbitrary frame work into which he has previously organised his word disappears. All that he is left with is the complete confusion of his in escapable existence and the realization that it has no meaningful order. When he becomes aware that only by his decision can be find a means of organising experience and a way of life, he is overwhelmed with the magnitude of the predicament that confronts him. He cannot avoid being a free agent. He cannot act unless he exercise his freedom and chooses some arbitrary outlook and order to make sense out of his world. Possible most frightening of all, he is permanently burdened with all the consequences of his decision for which he and he alone is responsible, and this is a 'dreadful responsibility'. Man is involved inevitably in anguish because his decision is never grounded in an external authority upon which he can rest the responsibility for his action. He must bear it alone. And when Sartre says alone, he means absolutely alone, for not only is their no God to share the burden, but there is no structure a priori for values to rest upon. For Sartre, the God does not exist is a dreadful fact that makes an ultimate difference to the world and to man.
