The deep truth of being human is that there is no objective experience.   
Our brains are not built to measure the absolute value of anything. All that we perceive and feel is colored by expectation, comparison, and circumstance. There is no pure sensation, only inference based on sensation.    

All that we perceive and feel is colored by expectation, comparison, and circumstance. There is no pure sensation, only inference based on sensation. Thirty minutes fly by in a conversation with a good friend, but seem interminable when waiting in line at the DMV. That fat raise you got at work seems nice until you learn that your co-worker got one twice as large as yours. A caress from your sweetheart during a loving, connected time feels warm and delightful, but the very same touch delivered during the middle of a heated argument feels annoying and presumptuous, bordering on violation.

### Satre ref on subjectivity   
There is no other universe except the human universe, the universe of human subjectivity.

### Human subjectivity and death : Psychogenic death 
https://www.salon.com/2021/12/31/psychogenic/  

For years Leach pondered these cases, wondering what could cause a person to die of hopelessness. Then, around 2016 he homed in on the relationship between the prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia, and the way dopamine in produced, or not produced, there. It was a revelation.  

"With the advances in neurology and neurochemistry," he said, "the pieces started to fall into place. After all these years trying to get an answer for this thing, when I finally did, I thought, 'This is too easy. That can't be right.'"  

When humans are faced with a threat, they deal with it in various mental ways. They either face the threat head on to defeat it, or they try to run away from it. This is known as "active coping."    
Since Cannon first described the "fight or flight," response, a third option has been added to the list: freeze. This is known as "passive coping," and it happens when a threat is perceived as inescapable. It's a way for the organism to conserve energy until the threat passes.    

But sometimes the threat — or the perception of it — doesn't pass. In that case, a person can lose hope of escape and, "the prefrontal cortex deliberately inhibits the production of dopamine in the basal ganglia to well below its functional level," says Leach. "That's associated with the feeling of hopelessness." If this continues for too long, it can become impossible to restart dopamine production.  The person in this situation begins a "spiral of disengagement," which consists of five stages:   
1) Withdrawal
2) Apathy
3) Aboulia (loss of emotional response, initiative and willpower)
4) Akinesia (lack of response to external stimuli, even to pain).

Most people who enter this neurological tailspin will emerge from it before they hit bottom. They take in new information. They adapt to the new situation. But the few who don't may find themselves at stage five: Psychogenic death. The light goes out of their eyes. They say their goodbyes. They may perk up briefly as if they finally have a goal they can imagine, a solution to their problem: That new goal is death. And within a day or so, they're gone.


### How mind effects the physical well being  
https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/01/26/464372009/how-meditation-placebos-and-virtual-reality-help-power-mind-over-body  

If we feel that we are in danger or under threat, the brain raises its sensitivity to symptoms like pain. ... Whereas, on the other hand, if we feel that we are safe and cared for and things are going to get better soon, we can kind of relax, we don't need to be so alert to these symptoms. So that's one thing that might be at play.  

...   

 One thing that people often don't realize about the placebo effect is there isn't just one placebo effect. There are many, depending on what we think a treatment is going to do for us. So, for example, if you take a fake painkiller, that actually reduces pain-related activity in the brain and the spinal cord and it causes the release of natural painkillers in the brain called endorphins. And these are actually the painkillers that opioid painkillers are designed to mimic, so it's working through the same biochemical pathway that a painkiller would work through. But if a patient with Parkinson's takes a placebo that they think is their Parkinson's drug, they get a flood of dopamine in the brain, which is exactly what you would see with the real drug.

Even with altitude sickness, for example, if somebody at altitude takes fake oxygen, you see a reduction in ... prostaglandins. ... These actually work to dilate blood vessels and they cause many of the symptoms of altitude sickness.

So what you see in all these different conditions is that taking a placebo, or, to be more accurate about it, our response to that placebo, can cause biological changes in the brain that actually ease our symptoms, and that's not something that's imaginary; that's something that's underpinned by these biological changes that are very similar to the biological changes you get when we take drugs.

 ... 
 I think, first of all, there is some evidence that honest placebos still work, so there are studies in various conditions, for example — irritable bowel syndrome, headaches, hyperactivity disorder — where patients have received placebos but they knew they were placebos and still got a benefit from that. 
 
 

### The Neuroscience of Language and Thought

Within the first 10 minutes he speaks of the fact that rational thought as we see it simply does not exist. All our choices are based on the ability to distinguish a preference and that ability is based on emotion.

### Effect of medicine/chemicals on human behaviour
Serotonin is the key hormone that stabilizes our mood, feelings of well-being, and happiness. It is found all around in body  
- in the brain. It is thought to regulate mood, happiness, and anxiety
- in your stomach and intestines. It helps control your bowel movements and function.
- Serotonin is responsible for stimulating the parts of the brain that control sleep and waking. Whether you sleep or wake depends on the area is stimulated and which serotonin receptor is used.
- Serotonin is released to help heal wounds. Serotonin triggers tiny arteries to narrow, which helps forms blood clots.
- Having very high levels of serotonin in the bones can lead to osteoporosis, which makes the bones weaker.

`Normal Level`:  you should feel more focused, emotionally stable, happier, and calmer.    
`Lower Level`: low levels of serotonin can lead to depression, anxiety, suicidal behavior, and obsessive-compulsive disorder.  
`Higher Level`: Too much serotonin can cause mild symptoms such as shivering, heavy sweating, confusion, restlessness, headaches, high blood pressure, twitching muscles, and diarrhea  


Serotonin selectively influences moral judgment and behavior through effects on harm aversion  
https://www.pnas.org/content/107/40/17433

 It's crazy how our brains and bodies are just a cocktail of hormones and neurotransmitters. Change that mix, and it can change the very nature of who we think we are. Things that you might associate with your very identity, like optimism/pessimism, ability to focus, moral judgment, how collaborative or generous you are, aggressiveness, all can be influenced by hormones or neurotransmitters.  
 - Enhancing serotonin made subjects less likely to reject unfair offers.
 - Enhancing serotonin made subjects more likely to judge harmful actions as forbidden, but only in cases where harms were emotionally salient.  

psychotic drugs and treatment alter serotonin levels (for depression problems) and dopamine in others. 

medications that inhibit or regulate serotonin, and every individual's experience will be slightly different based on their genetics and the circumstances of their life.
- serotonin blockers just made me asexual.
- For hyper sensitive people this could be better to mellow down the emotions. For normal people, further lowering the emotions may lead to feeling of apathy with potential negative side effects like compulsive lieing behaviour without feeling of guilt or shame, which they feel tragic about later when out of medications.
