> “Torture a single chicken and you risk arrest. Abuse hundreds of thousands of chickens for their entire lives? That’s agribusiness.”

The government condones this abhorent behaviour for their need to feed millions at affordable price. The burden of lower cost to populance  is born by animals who are bred in this hell farms who have no other mandate than to increase the meat production. 

The least we can do is absolute rejection of meat from any farm saying to self that "I don't need you to feed me at the cost of these torutured animals". As a meat eater, get meat from neighbourhood farms which you can see for yourself. The best to reduce, refuse and eventually go vegen.

**Vote with your conscience, every day and at every meal.**
