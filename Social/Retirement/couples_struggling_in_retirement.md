### More time at home amplifies disagreements 
“The relationship can have an identity crisis,” says Allison Howe, a therapist who works primarily with couples in New York. Howe says retirement is a time when the issues that couples have been avoiding — aided by the distractions of work or child rearing or both — come roaring to the forefront. “There are disagreements now about how to envision this new stage of life,” she says. “The retirement phase amplifies everything, actually — the absence of true collaboration, whether they were really friends, whether they had a shared narrative. All of these things get heightened now because we have less time.”

### disagree on spending time . Lack of company
Couples have less time on a grand scale while contending, suddenly, with more free time in their waking hours. Many disagree on how to spend it. “I can do anything I want, but lack an activity partner,” reported Danny Steiner, a recently retired 70-year-old high school teacher whose wife does not share his passion for travel — a difference that really manifested only once it was an option. More time can lay bare the reality that some couples did better with less of it. “Being together just does not feel as special as it once did,” said Martha Battie, a retired college administrator in Hanover, N.H. “Whatever conversations or sharing we have seems to be forgotten, or not really heard from the start.” And more time means more exposure to whatever irritating habits were easily endured in smaller doses. Among the things that grated on her, Barbara had texted, was that Joe “mansplains everything.” He had always been that way, she knew, but now she had to deal with so much more of it.

### Regrets about past
The couple had coexisted on separate tracks for many years, so much so that even the sweet moments of retirement, like weekends with their grandchildren, to whom Richard was devoted, kicked up feelings of regret and loss for Yvonne. As a working mother, she had done the large part of the child rearing on her own, without a fully invested partner. “He’ll say to me about the grandchildren, Wow, they’re so bright and interesting,” she said. “And I’ll say, You know, your own children were very bright and interesting, too.” Regrets about the past were colliding with the minutiae of how they would coexist as they faced aging together.

### Unwanted Intrusion . Privacy gone
Having left her largely in charge, for most of their marriage, of raising two daughters, dealing with the home and managing her own career, Richard now seemed to have had some late-in-life revelation that his wife could clearly benefit from his input. He had ideas about how she should manage her team, which he sometimes shared after she completed Zoom calls: She should have told them to solve a problem a certain way, or given them more direction. The advice irritated Yvonne, who is not a fan of micromanagement (of herself or others). “I’m a very private person,” Yvonne said, “and the fact that he was even listening to my phone calls was, my God, it was like: I can’t believe you’re doing this. What? Why are you here?” Sometimes he walked past her computer and waved and smiled and mugged for her co-workers, which annoyed her just as much as his unsolicited counsel.

Barbara briefed me on her experience before we met in person. Since retirement, she reported, Joe had found himself untethered. He was underfoot, always around and not exactly occupied. It was bad enough that he was spending hours on his phone scrolling through Instagram, bad enough that he was doing so on a couch in the living room, a space that had always been hers and hers alone throughout the day. Now he also wanted her to look at the funny dog videos that made him laugh, and yes, funny pig videos too. She did not find this particularly sexy, but he also wanted more sex than when he was working, one of many ways she felt the burden of keeping him entertained. “Love him very much,” she texted. “But I’m going crazy or going back to work, whichever comes first.”

### Getting work to avoid restlessness 
When Richard started picking up consulting work to stave off his own restlessness, he took over their kitchen, spreading papers and folders on various surfaces and leaving half-filled coffee cups and laptop chargers lying around. “It destroys the energy in the house,”

### Have money, have time . No Company
Barbara and Joe met 13 years ago, two divorced people who had relentlessly climbed their way up from working-class backgrounds. Barbara rose to be the vice president of a wholesale apparel business before moving into retail, then winding down her career; to keep herself busy, she sells clothing online a few hours a day. Joe co-founded a delivery business that he sold in 2021 for an amount that meant he would never have to work again; he retired in January last year. He and Barbara had time; they had money; they had leisure. They also had a problem: They were driving each other mad.  

### divorce
... retirement, like any major transition, often entails destabilizing shifts that take many people by surprise. Although it’s still rare for married couples over 60 to break up, the divorce rate is rising faster in that age group than in any other, as baby boomers accustomed to self-actualization reach retirement age and evaluate their lives anew.
