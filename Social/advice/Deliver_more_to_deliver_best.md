### People who produce most work also produce the best work

The best of artists, scientists and accomplished people in any field are the one who keep delivering the output. Most of the output would bad . mediocre. But some of it would be very, very good. The feedback process refines them.

Most of the people fall into the trap that they need to learn a lot or spend a lot of effort to do something big and beautiful that they envision. They have lot less chance to learn from outputs and are unable to get skilled.

If you want to be good at something then keep delivering it and learning at each output stage.

### Story
The ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class into two groups. All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right solely on its quality. His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the "quantity" group: fifty pound of pots rated an "A", forty pounds a "B", and so on. Those being graded on "quality", however, needed to produce only one pot -albeit a perfect one - to get an "A". Well, came grading time and a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity. It seems that while the "quantity" group was busily churning out piles of work - and learning from their mistakes - the "quality" group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.

### Analyze along with repeat practice
Time spent repeat practicing a skill only makes you faster / more robust at the method you already know; it doesn't lead you to improve your methods. So spend half your time actually performing the skill, and half the time analyzing your work / comparing to known good examples / planning how to improve (and, really, half of that time should be for improving your tools for analysis and comparison...). If you fail to do this kind of meta-work, 10000 hours of practice or whatever will just get you a fast, robust system for producing garbage.

### Keep yourself motivated by constant feedbacks from outputs
Longer the time to deliver an iteration, the more the chance to getting disinterested and giving up.  
Assuming you're following an intelligent process for learning the skill (see previous points), the most likely way in which you will fail to learn it is by getting disinterested or discouraged and giving up. It's essential that you try and structure your learning process in a way that yields intermediate feedback and some satisfaction for improvement, and pay attention to both 1) reducing the parts of the process you dislike and 2) figuring out ways to make it enjoyable (including figuring out how successful other people have managed to derive enjoyment from the activity).
