You find something that you would like to do. But it seems very hard. Is there is a dead simple process, following which the hard thing can be accomplished by any common person.

### Algo 1
1) Spend time to understand the thing that you are trying to do. You are not yet doing it, but just studying it. It means finding information about it.  
This is so that in the next step you would be breaking the thing into a simple enough part, which you think can be accomplished

2) Break the problem into smaller problem.  

3) From the broken down problem, pick up ONE thing/problem and just keep focus on it to get it done.  
Do not look at the the rest of parts or the complete big thing. Just get the one part done.

3) If the smaller problem is still difficult then go back to step1 else go to step 3

This is sure shot process of getting hard things done.

### Algo 1.1
If I wanted to learn to learn a difficult skill, such as writing a decent novel, I'd break it down as follows:
1) Research what skills I'll need to develop. At my current stage of learning I don't know what I don't know.

2) Figure out a path to start developing skills. This might be writing a small story every single day while also reading books/guides on how to develop as a writer. I'm still writing daily.

3) As I'm becoming mor comfortable writing anything I now need to develop skills on writing specific things. How do I flesh out a character, how do I describe settings, etc. I'm still writing daily.

4) Once I've figured out individual building blocks I'd then teach myself how to construct them together. What elements do stories contain? How do I flow between small sections to weave a larger tale? I'm still writing daily.

I'm sure as I become a more knowledgeable and skilled writer I'd identify other areas I need to work on, skills to develop, etc. It all comes down to identify small blocks and build from there.

### Algo 2
1) Find something that is like the hard thing but is easy.
2) Modify the easy thing so that it is like the hard thing in exactly one way that you find hard.
3) Do the modified thing until it is no longer hard.
4) If you get stuck, do one of the following:
    1) Go back to step 3 and pick a different way in which the problem is hard.
    2) Recursively apply the general system for learning to do hard things to the thing you’re stuck on.
    3) Go ask an expert or a rubber duck for advice.
    4) If you’re still stuck after trying the first three, it’s possible that you may have hit some sort of natural difficulty limit and may not be able to make progress.
5) If the original hard thing is now easy, you’re done. If not, go back to step 2.

### Case Study
A case study for this would be to learn to solve rubix cube. You would be a learn to solve it layer by layer where at each layer you will find different set of challenges. But by breaking it into parts and focusing on one part at a time even 7 year olds can learn to solve the cube in no time
