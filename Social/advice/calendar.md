Calendar is an essential tool to maximize personal productivity

### Only things that can be done at specific time/date
The purpose of calendar is to put things which have to done at specific time and date only. If something can be done at any time, then it belongs to task list or project plan  
Come out of the urge to put everything on calendar so that it can be done . Aka "what is scheduled is done". This ends up in doing things which are lower in priority than which needs to done at exact time.  

### If you agree on appointment then record it immediately

### Check your calendar daily
Check daily to see what is upcoming and if you have missed on something


### Task Vs Calendar Event
Event have to done at specific time.  
Task are things to be done, not specifically at a certain time.  
An Event may require certain tasks done before it or after it.
