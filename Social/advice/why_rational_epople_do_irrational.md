1) Pressure
2) Opportunity
3) Rationalization

Eg: Somebody tries to accept bribes , or commits fraud

pressure: eg: He is in financial difficult times.    
Opportunity: He is in position of authority or the boss trusts him too much. He thinks he can get away without anybody knowing.  
Rationalization: He thinks he deserves better salary at work

In this three steps, otherwise perfectly rational people, convince themself of doing irrational stuff.  

Stay aware of this trap in thinking.
