In short term, you can often get away with not putting much effort. You may be lucky or better skilled than others around you or just that things were easy. 

But in long term your attitude and mindset towards failure and learning becomes much more important. Since in long term, life will throw challenges and impedements and at that point the winners are the ones who have the right attitude of not giving up and learning from failures and taking chances.

Example can be high school which is too easy for most smart students who get away with little effort. However in university, only those with right attitude get things done.
