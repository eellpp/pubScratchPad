### Money won’t change you it only reveals your true nature. 

Money contains value, having more money means more value. Yes money does not change you but people will feel you are different. Not because you are different but your nature is amplified.

It means that if you are a drug user, it will be amplified to the extreme that you will abuse more drugs.

If you are a rebel, you become more dangerous to buy more weapons and kill more people.

If you are a charity person, you become more giving and more helpful.

If you are a glamorous person, you will be more glamorous because you have more to spend.

If you like muscle cars, then you will have more of them.

If you love women, you will have more women, spend more time in clubs.

Money does not change you, but when you show yourself to the extreme, people will think you have changed, but the reality is that you are more of what you are.

YEAR1: Mr Richard Lau and Madam Cynthia Sng, who were in their mid-50s at the time, entered into an option to buy the property for $4.925 million in July 2020. Funds for the purchase were raised through various loans, which were eventually repaid through the sale of three other properties and by liquidating several of the couple’s assets. 

That same month, the couple also hired a lawyer to draw up a trust deed to state that they were holding the property as joint trustees for the sole benefit of their only son, the elder of their two children.

YEAR2: In 2021, the couple’s relationship turned rocky. Madam Sng filed for divorce while Mr Richard Lau moved to a Lorong Ah Soo flat.

YEAR3: In 2022, Mr Alistair Lau applied for a High Court declaration that the deed be terminated and the property be vested in him immediately.
