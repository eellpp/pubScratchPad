### Comparing Pace
Don't compare yourself with anyone else.  
Everyone is at a different pace.  
It doesnâ€™t matter if the other person is way ahead. What matters is your own journey in finding what you enjoy in life.  

### Age and Pace
Age is just a number, and most importantly everybody has different paths and the only thing that should matter to you is YOUR PACE.

### Factors affecting pace of life 
The pace for everyone is decided by many factors including  
- the family they are born in and society around them
- their personal experiences
- their decisions and trade offs
