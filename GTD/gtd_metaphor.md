The daily GTD and weekend mindsweep is somewhat related to metaphors on technical debt and kitchen organizing.   

### Restaurant Metaphor
Before the start of restaurant day:  
- Take stock of inventory
- mise en place. This French term, meaning "everything in its place", refers to the extensive preparation of ingredients and arrgements before service.

During the day:  
- Cleanup before start. Cleanup as you go. Cleanup after you are done.  

End of Day:  
- Cleanup for the day
- Handle any preparations which needs to be done today for next day. Like marination, slow roast etc  
- Decide next day menu. Place orders for fish, wine etc.
