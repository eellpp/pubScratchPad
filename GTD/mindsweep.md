You have to identify what’s not on cruise control. That is the things that we have attention on. Anything which pops up in your head and grabs attention should be on cruise control. The reason things have your attention is because you have not put sufficient attention on them.  

#### First Time Mindsweep
If you’re doing work, what are the four, five, six, seven things you are supposed to be handling well? First of all, is your job clear itself? Anything unclear about that, you need to grab? Things changed, things have morphed, things have shifted in the company, your responsibilities, all that clear and on cruise control yet? And whatever those areas you’re responsible for, research, PR, business development stuff, sales, marketing, anything about staff, staff development, hiring, performance reviews, etcetera? Assets, quality control, tech stuff? Come performance review time what are you going to be held accountable to have done well over this period of time?  

So thinking about all that, does anything pop into your head that you haven’t grabbed yet? Projects, more subtle stuff that’s kind of been hanging out there, possibilities, opportunities, someday/maybe’s.  

 how about your own just personal and professional development? Anything about classes; anything you’re trying to learn? Anything you’d like to research, get better at; anything on your mind about that? Personal finances, assets, investments, bank stuff?  
 
 What are the things you like to do, anything even on your mind, you might want to – you know, concerts, subscription series, plays, you know, fun things, things to do with the family?  
 
 Speaking of family, anything about your relationships, if you haven’t caught it yet; personal, direct family relationships, extended family, good friends, your network, pets  
 
 Your creativity, your creative expression – everything okay about that? Any classes you want to take? Things you might want to do? And how about all your gear; all your gear okay; printers, faxes, scanners, blackberries, IPhones?  
 
#### Daily Mindsweep

Anything about vacation, planning, family, social events, nitty-gritty work stuff, projects – projects that have emerged that you haven’t identified as such yet.

Anything on your mind that you call a problem right now that you need to grab to later on make a project?

Real good idea to do a site walk-around in your mind’s eye. So if you are in your office right now, look around. Anything on the tables, on the desk, on the side bar credenzas, your in-baskets, your pending areas? Anything representing new stuff that’s shown up, you’ve haven’t had a chance to identify yet as something you need to do something about.  

Anything that reminds you about meetings, people, projects, problems, situations, opportunities that are up and haven’t been caught yet.  

#### Example of a thought lifecycle in GTD
You don’t have to finish executing the thought, but you do need to clarify what exactly it means to you, what does “done” mean and what does doing look like and park those things appropriately.  

Example : ***`Mom birthday`***  

Is it actionable?  Basic question; two optional answers yes or no. You gonna do something about mom or not?  
Maybe I want to put her birthday on a spread sheet where I’m keeping track of birthdays, so it’ll become a piece of reference. Or maybe it’s incubate. Maybe her birthday’s not coming up for another six weeks. You don’t want to decide yet, then you say, “Hmm, you know, let me think that – I’ll just kind of sleep on that for a couple of weeks. That’ll give me still plenty of time to do something about it.” So then you can put a trigger in your calendar or in a tickler file and then come back to it.  
If it is actionable, you go, “Oh yeah, I guess I gotta do something about mom and her birthday.” Then, there’s two questions and you see them almost side bar there, you see that there’s a little dotted line that goes up to the left called “What’s the desired outcome?” That means that there’s more than one step to this. If you say, “Look, all I just want to do is I’m gonna call mom and leave her a message and wish her a happy birthday” and you can do that in two minutes, well that’s just not a multi-step thing, that’s just – okay that’s the next action. It’s called “mom”, you can do it in two minutes, so that would fit in the two-minute rule that you see down there under do it, so you can just do that.  
If likely, that kind of scenario, you say, “Nah, we need to give mom a birthday party.” Or perhaps it’s like I need to look into whether my sister and I really want to do this or not for her. Then that might be what I call R&B, that’s my shorthand for look into project. But anyway, that would be a desired outcome, which you’d see if I’d say, “Yes, gonna – either I’m gonna give mom a birthday party or I’m gonna research it.” Now you have a project.  
That’s a stake in the ground you need to park somewhere and then keep reminding yourself that you have that commitment now to get that done. So you know, it gets back to the simplicity of Getting Things Done is defining what “done” means. Well, what does done mean about mom and birthday? Is it just that you researched it to make a go or no-go decision or you’ve actually celebrated her birthday? In either case, that would go on your project list and, of course, tied very directly to that, is “What’s the next action?”  
Basically if you’ve done all that, you’ve made those decisions, parked them somewhere and then of course, what we can’t handle on the phone here is then making sure you have some regular review you trust then that where you park these things, you’re actually going to engage with appropriately. You’re gonna look at that project list and see mom’s birthday coming toward you frequently enough to make sure it doesn’t slip and you’re gonna see the reminder to make the phone call in some appropriate time and place so you can do that in time.
