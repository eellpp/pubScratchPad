Average attention spans work out like this:

|Age|Time|
|---|---|
|2 years old| four to six minutes|
|4 years old| eight to 12 minutes|
|6 years old| 12 to 18 minutes|
|8 years old| 16 to 24 minutes|
|10 years old| 20 to 30 minutes|
|12 years old| 24 to 36 minutes|
|14 years old| 28 to 42 minutes|
|16 years old| 32 to 48 minutes|

#### Task too easy or too difficult causes attention distraction
- If task is too difficult : Self awareness of this situations that causes drift. Break down the problem and focus on the pieces. 
- If tasks is too easy

#### Too many thing weighing in on your mind
Having too many different things competing for your attention and weighing on your mind.
Practice GTD and keep mind clean

#### reduce the distractions in our life
At least distractions that are present when we are trying to remember something.  

#### Assign importance to paying attention and remembering. 
If you don't think something is important, your brain won't commit enough circuitry to handle the information.

#### Expect and demand of yourself successful remembering. Make forgetting unacceptable.  
Expect and demand of yourself successful remembering. Make forgetting unacceptable.  

#### Get engaged with the information. 
Ask yourself or others questions about it. Think about it in different ways. Boring stuff is killer for brain  

#### Multitasking
multitasking training can help improve attention. 
- One of the ways to train is using specifically created video games.  
- In daily life, make use of the opportunity to do task multitasking. Eg live coding and chatting during coding  
this leads to robust increases in activity in those parts of the brain’s prefrontal cortex associated with greater cognitive control.  

### Context Switching between unrelated tasks
task switching is when you shift your attention from one task to another and is prompted by interruptions in your workflow. Meanwhile, context switching is when you jump between various, unrelated tasks. These unrelated task switch cause heavy productivity loss and even 
Multitasking on related tasks, helps keep you engaged and in zone. But while on unrelated tasks has an opposite long term effect 

It ruins productivity, causes mistakes, and impedes creative thought. … As humans, we have a very limited capacity for simultaneous thought, we can only hold a little bit of information in the mind at any single moment.  

Another study conducted in the University of California, discovered that it takes an average of 23 minutes and 15 seconds to refocus on a task after an interruption.  

Context Switching multitasking like checking on social media creates a dopamine-addiction feedback loop, effectively rewarding the brain for losing focus and for constantly searching for external stimulation. Just like the effects of a drug, our brains can get addicted to the dopamine rush from switching tasks and losing focus. Once this happens, it becomes very difficult to break the cycle. Next time, as you are getting into the zone, there is strong urge to disconnect and engage into the distracting tasks. 

Since quality focus and attention is required for learning, multitasking hinders our ability to learn and interpret information effectively. This draws down your general IQ level.  
#### Take Rest
Try to stay rested, alert, and sharp. Nobody focuses well when they are tired.  

### Exercise and outdoors  
Activities such as spending more time outdoors, exercise, cognitive training, and meditation are ways in which people at any age can enhance their ability to concentrate.  

In general, you have to put conscious effort to have sustained attention. Pick up and engineer the tasks such that they keep you in the zone.

### Directed Attention 
1) you’re focused on something;   
2) your focus is under your control; and 
3) you’re focused on the right thing at the right time.
 
#### two major kinds of distraction.

#### Hijacked Distraction
 1) you’re focused on something; but 2) you’re not in control of your attention; and 3) you’re focused on the wrong thing.

#### Aimless Distraction
 In this case, 1) you’re not focused, 2) you’re not in control, and 3) you’re focused on the wrong thing (or nothing).  

### Mind-Wandering vs distraction
 In other words, 1) you’re not focused, and 2) you’re not in control, but 3) you’re not supposed to be focused on something. So you're okay. 
Mind-wandering is psychologically restorative, and contributes to your creative energies, in a way that hijacked attention and aimlessness do not. Mind-wandering is what Charles Darwin did during his daily walks, walks that often ended with him so deep in thought that his children played tricks on him to test his concentration. Mind-wandering lets your conscious mind have a break, while allowing your subconscious to keep working, testing combinations, trying out scenarios, without your being aware of it. Mind-wandering isn't the opposite of focus. It's more like a complement to it. You need both to do good work, to be creative and productive, and to have a good life.

`External distractions`:  
External distractions include factors such as visual triggers, social interactions, music, text messages, and phone calls.

`Internal Triggers`:  
Internal distractions such as hunger, fatigue, illness, worrying, and daydreaming


### connections between paying attention, filtering out interference, and remembering
The connections between paying attention, filtering out interference, and remembering are critical because it’s obviously far more difficult to retrieve something never properly imprinted in the first place. Here’s one of the ways we get derailed: Even that casual mention of unfolding catastrophe in Syria in the last paragraph may set off a distracting internal dialogue


### Stickiness of perception
Why even healthy adults suffer progressively high deficits in responding to competing claims on attention. Older adults typically experience more difficulty in switching between tasks, partly because of what Gazzaley called “stickiness of perception.”  This sticky quality of perception as we age, which means that we leave multiple channels of perception and attention cracked open when we switch from doing one thing to another.

### engagement, disengagement, and re-engagement for switching between tasks
“Older adults appear to have a problem in re-engaging, but also in disengaging,” Gazzaley explained. When you switch tasks, you’re basically going from one complex network to another. If that transition is sluggish from disuse or changes in the brain – in the neurochemistry – you’ll feel the consequences.”   
- Limiting the costs of disengagement  and 
- ease the transition to re-engagement
Speed and Flexibilty of information processing is high in young adults  
Capacity to remain focused increases with age  
While many visual and cognitive abilities seem to peak in early adulthood and decline thereafter, findings from researchers at VA Boston Healthcare System and Harvard University indicate that a person’s ability to sustain attention seems to be get better over time, reaching its peak around age 43.  
While younger adults may excel in the speed and flexibility of information processing, adults approaching their mid-years may have the greatest capacity to remain focused.  

As you get older, it is easier to get distracted. It is as if we get "attention deficit disorder (ADD)" as we age.  

A brain-scan study at the University of Toronto found that older people, compared to young adults, have decreased brain activity in brain areas that enable concentration This means that older brains can't focus well, because the parts of the brain that enable concentration don't get active enough.

To compound the problem, older people show increased activity in parts of the brain that don't normally get activated during memory tasks in younger people. The explanation for this is that the brains of older people need to assign the attentiveness and memory work to more parts of brain. That is, they have to recruit more circuitry to do the same job young brains can do with fewer brain resources. However, you look at it, the findings document an age-related decline in the brain's ability to focus its neural resources on memory tasks. What may be most worrisome is that the brain shows such signs of decline around age 40.  

### Suppression of unwanted thoughts become difficult during aging
Yet another study, this one from the U. California at San Francisco, confirmed that older people tend to have difficulty in ignoring distractions and irrelevant stimuli. Subjects performed a memory task of ignoring a previous stimulus that was still in working memory. In other words, the subject had to suppress the memory of irrelevant stimuli. The results showed that older individuals could focus on pertinent information but had difficulty in ignoring irrelevant or distracting information that was contained in working memory. However, about half of the older adults did not have this problem. 


### Flow and Distraction
To perform a challenging task optimally, you need to reach a state of flow, where you give your complete attention to one activity. Studies have shown that it takes around 15 minutes of uninterrupted work on the task to reach this state.  
Schedule complex tasks such that they have your undivided attention  



### Industry treats attention as a commodity
There is a conscious effort to capture and commodify your attention by social media, videogame designers and marketers. Casino operators use these tricks to keep you away from doing what you really think you should do and instead chase what they want you to do.
