We craft research-based curricular modules for grades 6-12. Our materials reinforce core concepts from mainstream subjects like Math, Physics and more, enabling non-CS teachers to adopt our introductory materials while delivering rigorous and engaging computing content drawn from CS classes at universities like Brown, WPI, and Northeastern.

Our Algebra class can be integrated into a standalone CS or mainstream math class, and aligns with national and state math standards. And since every child takes algebra - regardless of gender or background - Bootstrap is one of the largest providers of formal CS education to girls and underrepresented students nationwide.

#### Computational modeling in Algebra, Physics & Data Science, for all students.
