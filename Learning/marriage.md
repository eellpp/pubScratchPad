The best advice is choosing someone to marry is to find someone who is kind.  

If you are married for any period of significant time, your spouse will see your very worst self and you will see theirs. The goal is to work on making yourself a better mate and a better person every single day. A good spouse notices, appreciates, and love and respect grow. Nothing magical or mystical about it.  

The relationship in marriage should strive to become a zone of peace and privacy.
