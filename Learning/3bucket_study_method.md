Three Buckets of knowledge 
1. **Know** : Review and Reinforce Time
2. **Know Don't Know** : Study and Understand Time
3. **Don't know Don't Know** : Scout Time

Suggested proportion of time allocation in table format based on the 3-bucket study method:

| **Study Category**                          | **Proportion of Time** | **Description**                                                                 |
|---------------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **What You Know**  [K]                         | 50%                    | Review and reinforce material you are confident about.                          |
| **What You Know You Don't Know**    [KDK]                 | 30%                    | Focus on understanding and improving areas where you have knowledge gaps.       |
| **What You Don't Even Know That You Don't Know** [DKDK]      | 20%                    | Explore new topics and ideas to uncover unknowns and broaden your knowledge.    |

## Generalized version of the study method in table format that can apply to any subject


| **Concept**                              | **Study Strategy**                                                                 | **Example Application**                                                                                     |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Reinforce What You Think You Know**     | - Active Recall & Self-Testing<br> - Teach Back Method<br> - Mind Mapping<br> - Periodic Review | - Use flashcards or quizzes to test knowledge of core concepts.<br> - Explain key ideas to a peer or in writing.<br> - Create a mind map to visualize connections between topics.<br> - Schedule regular review sessions to revisit what you've learned. <br> - Apply concepts through teaching, tutoring, or creating content (e.g., blogs, videos). |
| **Improve on What You Know You Don’t Know** | - Focused Learning Blocks<br> - Problem-Solving & Application<br> - Guided Learning Resources<br> - Review and Adjust | - Set aside time to study areas you’ve identified as weaknesses.<br> - Apply the concepts in practice problems or real-life situations.<br> - Use structured courses, books, or tutorials to guide your learning.<br> - Periodically evaluate progress and adjust your approach as needed. <br> - Engage in problem-solving exercises, case studies, or projects to solidify understanding.|
| **Challenge Yourself to Explore Unknown Unknowns** | - Diverse Learning Experiences<br> - Curiosity-Driven Exploration<br> - Question Assumptions<br> - Collaborative Exploration | - Explore topics or subjects outside your usual area of study.<br> - Read articles, watch videos, or attend lectures on unfamiliar subjects.<br> - Reflect on your assumptions and seek alternative perspectives.<br> - Work on interdisciplinary projects or with peers from different backgrounds. <br> - Explore new fields through hands-on experiments, collaborations, or creative projects|

This table breaks down the concepts and strategies that can be applied to any subject, helping reinforce known knowledge, improve on areas of weakness, and explore new, uncharted areas.
