### skill of effortless concentration, peak experience

He is conscious, but not thinking, not over-trying. As soon as he attempts to exercise control, he loses it.  
When someone is in this state and you ask him to explain how he performing so well, which forces him to think, he would no longer be able to perform so well.  
When you are playing, you have to become one with ball and racket. If you start to think of how good/bad you are playing , or anything else that separtes you from the action, at that moment you start to make mistakes. Mistakes which you know you should not be making but still make.  

"Oh, here comes the ball; it's coming pretty fast. It should bounce near the base line, and I'd better hit it on the rise." No, you simply watch the ball and let the proper response take place. You must your senses. The touch for the feeling. Ears and eyes. All these let you feel and feeling is knowing. Don't get the thoughts seperate mind from doer.

While playing a game if you have learnt to control your mind, to concentrate the energy of awareness, that is much more important than the game you are playing.

***`Self1`*** : The teller  
***`Self2`*** : The doer  

By thinking too much and trying too hard, Self 1 has produced tension and muscle conflict in the body. He is responsible for the error, but he heaps the blame on Self 2 and then, by condemning it further, undermines his own confidence in Self 2.  

### Tricks
Get the Self1 to focus on something else so that it doesn't interrupt the self1.  
Eg: Focus consciously on the seams of the ball and let the natural play happen. This will keep Self1 busy while self2 plays on. This trick requires trust on yourself, so that the conscious mind is kept busy on something else.  

We have arrived at a key point: it is the constant "thinking" activity of Self 1, the ego-mind, which causes interference with the natural doing processes of Self 2. Harmony between the two selves exists when the mind itself is quiet. Only when the mind is still is one's peak performance reached.  

### Zen art of archery
As soon as we reflect, deliberate, and conceptualize, the original unconsciousness is lost and a thought interferes. . . The arrow is off the string but does not fly straight to the target, nor does the target stand where it is. Calculation,, which is miscalculation, sets in...  
Man is a thinking reed but his great works are done when he is not calculating and thinking. "Childlikeness" has to be restored with long years of training in self-forgetfulness.  

### Peak Experience
- when you feel integrated (both the self are one)
- when you are egoless (quiet mind)
- effortless
- free of blocks, inhibitions, cautions, fears, doubts, contralsm reservations, self-criticism,
- is here-now, non wishing, non-string just is

during peak action experience the mind is not distrubing telling what to do. Instead there is free flow of action. You experience ecstacy and timelessness  

Quieting the mind means less thinking, calculating, judging, worrying, fearing, hoping, trying, regretting, controlling, jittering or distracting.  

Stop judging yourself when you are in action. This is one of the key points.  
Judgements are expressed by verbal and facial actions.  This is the self1 experssion.  
When you start judging the mind is no longer still. The constant self evaluation.   

***Relaxed state:***  
Only in a relaxed state of mind you can perform at peak. When you are tensed the fluidity of actions is gone.   
The tension occurs when you start to judge your actions. As good or bad. This brings in interferences from emotions like anger, frusterations or discouragement. But this does not mean you should ignore the errors.It means observing the events as facts and not adding to them.  

### unblocking the natural and speedy process of change:
All errors and mistakes are part of learning and growing up. The have to be observed as facts, as they are, and not used for judging self and growing negativity. Acceptance of mistakes automatically begins the recovery process. This is the way to handle it rather than punishing self.  

When the mind is free of any thoughts or judgements, then only we can see our errors as they are. As if we are seeing them in mirror. The self realization of mistake brings in auto correction. Let your body do its thing. All you have to do is give a quiet mind and full attention that it deserves.  

### self awareness
This is seeing yourself doing things as they are without getting judgemental.  

letting go of the value judgements, enjoying things as they are and doing things that seems sensible at the moment  

Natural learning process within everyone if one watches himself with detachment and interest.   

### Compliments are criticisms in disguise making one to live upto an expectation:
When you get complimented, you try to live up to an expectation. Then the self1,jedgemental,ego mind interferes and keeps us away from self awareness of things happening around. Thus we start making mistakes. Self1 is always looking for approval and avoiding disapproval. Once the expectations of what is good and bad is setup, self1 tries to interfere with emotional thoughts. "I should try not failing at this otherwise ..."  

- trying too hard causes tension, using too many muscles, thus you are not relaxed and not performing at optimum  
- too much of self instructions causes lack of concentration  

signs of self1 : tense cheek muscles, facial experession when all that is required is muscular action, spoken words  
Power comes from flexiblity  of muscles. This comes from relaxed state.  

### What is detached interest ?
A child learning to walk does it in clumsy way. Each of their fall is not judged upon by mother. She watches with detached interest, knowing that she is not the child but still having tremendous interest. Each of your mistakes should be watched upon with this same detached interest as mother with her child.  You are not your mistake. You are not even your body. Trust your body as it learns and it will perform beyond your wild expectations.  

### What is the role of self1 ?
The role of self1 is in setting up of goals, before the action started.  

### Learning by watching
As you watch a top performer at his peak, watch it without egoless mind. Then all the actions and body movements will seep inside and you would know how to perform. This is how some people learn dancing in a few hours without going to years of classes. Looking, feeling and doing.  

This also means that to get the skills in the domain, observe and be in company with the top in the field. The knowledge just seeps in through observation. You are not able to explain it in words but are just a able to do it. For person outside, this would feel like superheroic. But to the person doing thing, he is just standing on the shoulders on giants who are themself standing on shoulders on others before them.  


### How to programme self2 and tell what to do ?
Self2 learning visually through images. It might be through observing an expert do it or by means of imagination. Say you are not able to get the ball across the net with force. Then imagine the ball landing across the net and your body actions as you do it. Now play the game.  
During this process the self1 should relax and refrain from giving how-to-do instructions.  

Remember that if you try to force your action, it will probably tighten yourself, so just let it go. Let it be flexible; allow it to go as much as it wants to. Encourage it, but don't force it. Not trying does not mean being limp. Discover for yourself what it does mean.  

Surrender self1's (ego mind) control and allow self2, the body to perform spontaneously. Allow your muscle memories to react.   
The memory is not just in mind.  

### Changing old bad habits by simply watching it with detachment.
While performing don't analyze. Simple see what is happening. This detached observation would auto correct the self2. This is the way to pass information to self2. Let self1 relax and trust self2 more.   

Letting go of judgments, the art of programming with images and "letting it happen" are three of the basic skills involved in the Inner Game. 

***here are two main things:***  
1. Quieting the mind by letting go of mental self-instructions and trusting the body to do what comes most naturally.
2. Concentration

### Role Playing
Imagine yourself in shoes of someone else. A master or an expert whom you have observed playing and doing things. Start with role playing without focusing on results. This will break the pattern of bad habits and make you discover new approaches for self2 to perform.  

### Awareness of what is. without judgment, is relaxing, and is the best precondition for change.  
The first step into changing habit is to observe yourself doing it. Then know what you want it to be like. Then observe it again. This is programming the self2  
	

### Programming by observing
One way to do this might be to watch the motion of someone who does what you what you want to learn. Don't overanalyze; simply absorb what you see and try to feel what he feels. Hold this mental image for a minute or so, then ask your body to do whatever is necessary to produce the desired power. If results does not come immediately, don't force it. Trust the process, and let it happen. If after a short while the action does not seem to be moving in the direction of desired results, you may want to return to Step 1. If you are in any doubt, ask the pro to show you the motion, not tell you about it.  


### Deception of Self1
After getting the desired results by programming the self2 and allowing self1 to relax, very often the self1 takes over and again we start doing wrong. The issue is the ego who want the credit for success in achievent. Allowing self2 to do on its own does not allow ego to take credit and so eventually ego takes over and self1 is again in control.  
The secret of constant achievement is to let the self1 relax while doing things. 

#### Doing things that lets self1 take control:
- when you show your skills to others (ego mind)
- when you force yourself to improve your skills
- when you have emotions that you are not good or very good etc.
