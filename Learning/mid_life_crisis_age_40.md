### Happiness is related to your bodies hard wired emotional state
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25447488
I recently read a story about two people on their death beds, both had worked hard and achieved success in their fields. One was happily reflective and talked about what a journey life had been, the other was upset and remorseful, talking about how much time he had wasted.
I wonder if the contents of your life are secondary to your semi-hardwired emotional state.

### Life begins at 40: the demographic and cultural roots of the midlife crisis
2019 Wilkins–Bernal–Medawar lecture

the midlife crisis became a popular means of describing how—and why—men and women around the age of 40 became disillusioned with work, disenchanted with relationships and detached from family responsibilities.  
midlife crisis as a manifestation of either biological or psychological change, as a moment in the life course when—perhaps for the first time—people felt themselves to be declining towards death.  

features of a midlife crisis:  
- disillusionment with life; 
- dissatisfaction with work; 
- a desperation to postpone mental and physical decline; 
- detachment from family responsibilities; 
- and infidelity with a younger, more athletic accomplice. 

One of the few authentic class-differences, as opposed to class-distinctions, still existing in England is that the working classes age very much earlier. They do not live less long, provided that they survive their childhood, nor do they lose their physical activity earlier, but they do lose very early their youthful appearance. This fact is observable everywhere, but can be most easily verified by watching one of the higher age groups registering for military service; the middle- and upper-class members look, on average, ten years younger than the others  

It is a paradox of life that we do not begin to live until we begin to die. Death begins at thirty, that is, deterioration of the muscle cells sets in. Most old age is premature, and attention to diet and exercise would enable men and women to live a great deal longer than they do to-day. 

Gayelord Hauser's best-selling Look younger, live longer focused on the manner in which readers could ensure good health in later life not only by adopting balanced diets, but also by balancing their personality, mind, activities, emotions, recreation, friends, budget and marriage.  

Striking out on a fresh course after 40 failed to stem fears of approaching death, leading often to the same set of personal and family challenges from which those at midlife had sought to escape.
