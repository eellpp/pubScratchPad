Strategy of a very successful author with multiple best seller books: Make yourself extremely bored and a book will come out since he needs to entertain himself. This will work for everyone. Social media and news cycle are things that run counter to this. The whole business strategy of these time sinks are to occupy your free cycles of brain and put it to work to make money for them.   

### Getting Bored as a strategy
If you’re waiting for brilliance to strike, try getting bored first. Studies have found that boredom can spark individual productivity and creativity.  
In the study, people who had gone through a boredom-inducing task — methodically sorting a bowl of beans by color, one by one — later performed better on an idea-generating task than peers who first completed an interesting craft activity.

### Dopamine and phone/social media usage
Dopamine is a brain chemical that literally makes us happy, and it is released every time we receive something on our phones. It could be a text from a loved one, a “like” on Facebook, or a bit of breaking news we find interesting. Dopamine feels good, so we keep checking our phones, hoping to get a little hit of it. 

Today people are consuming media the same way they were consuming fast food in the 1950s

### Switch Cost

Sometimes the switch from one task to another costs us only a few tenths of a second, but in a day of flip-flopping between ideas, conversations, and transactions on a phone or computer, our switch costs can really add up, and make us more error-prone, too. Psychologist David Meyer who’s studied this effect estimates that shifting between tasks can use up as much as 40% of our otherwise productive brain time.

Every time we switch tasks, we’re also shooting ourselves up with a dose of the stress hormone cortisol, Lustig says. The switching puts our thoughtful, reasoning prefrontal cortex to sleep, and kicks up dopamine, a brain chemical that plays a key role in pursuing reward and motivation.
